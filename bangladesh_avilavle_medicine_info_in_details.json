      "indications": "3 Bion is indicated where a deficiency of the relevant vitamins exists. It is indicated for the treatment of following diseases: Polyneuropathy of any origin such alcoholic or toxiconeuropathies as-diabetic, Neuritis, Neuralgia, Cervical Syndrome, Shoulder-arm syndrome, Lumbago, Sciatica, Myalgia, Intercostal neuralgia, Herpes Zoster, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Supportive treatment in facial paresis.",
      "mode_of_action": "Vitamin B1 converts carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids into energy, promotes healthy nerves, improves mood, strengthens the heart. Vitamin B6 forms RBCs, helps cells to make proteins, manufactures neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin and releases stored forms of energy, helps to prevent CVS diseases and stroke, helps to lift depression and eases insomnia. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases.The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.",

      "indications": "3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-C is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-C did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",

      "indications": "3-Geocef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-Geocef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3-Geocef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-Geocef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-Geocef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",

      "indications": "Vitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. 3D is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth, preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. 3D is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. 3D has vital role on immunity boost up.",
      "mode_of_action": "The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.",
      "dosage": "For capsule: Adults: Treatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day. To confirm the target level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, measurement of it should be determined 3-4 months after initiating the maintenance therapy. Prevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 4 weeks. Higher doses may be required in certain situations. Addition to specific therapy for osteoporosis: 20000 IU once a month. For capsule: Children (12-18 years): Treatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. Prevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 6 weeks. For film-coated tablet: 1000 IU (1-2 tablets) daily, or as directed by physician. Take the medicine with food or within 1 hour after a meal.For oroflash or chewable tablets: 1000 IU to 2000 IU daily, or as directed by physician.

Place the tablet in mouth swallow after chewing.For Oral Solution: Up to one year: 400 IU once a day or as directed by the physician. 1 year to 18 years: 600 IU once a day or as directed by the physician. Injection: For treatment- Rickets: 1 ampoule every 2 weeks for one month then 1 ampoule for every 4 months Osteoporosis: 1 ampoule every 2 weeks for 3 months Osteomalacia: 1 ampoule every 2 weeks for 3 months Tetany caused by hypocalcaemia: 1 ampoule for every 4 months which may be increased to 2 ampoules Menopause: 1 ampoule for every 6 months Vitamin 03 deficiency: 1 ampoule can be repeated 1 to 6 months later Injection: For prevention- Pregnancy: 1/2 ampoule at 6th or 7th months During breastfeeding: 1/2 ampoule for every 6 months Children up to 5 years: 1 ampoule for every 6 months Adolescent: 1 ampoule for every 6 months Elderly Dosages: 1/2 ampoule for every 3 months. Direction of use of Injection-For oral use- Step-1: Place the thumb on ampoule and break the upper narrow part of the ampoule. Step-2: Pour out the solution of the ampoule in a spoon. Step-3: Mix the solution with water or milk before oral use. For lM use- Step-1: Place the thumb on ampoule and break the upper narrow part of the ampoule. Step-2: Then use as IM injection.",
      "interaction": "Drug interaction with medication: Concomitant treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates can decrease the effect of vitamin D because of metabolic activation. Concomitant use of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of vitamin D. The effectsof digitalis and other cardiac glycosides may be accentuated with the oral administration of calcium combined with vitamin D. Strict medical supervision is needed and, if necessary monitoring of ECG and calcium. Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resins such as cholestyramine or laxatives such as paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D. The cytotoxic agent actinomycin and imidazole antifungal agents interfere with vitamin D activity by inhibiting the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidney enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase.",
      "contraindications": "Vitamin D3 is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D3 (or medicines of the same class) and any of the excipients. It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.",
      "side_effects": "Generally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few most common side effects can generally occur including hypocalcaemia syndrome or calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypocalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of colecalciferol.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Studies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required. During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatmentVitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.",
      "precautions": "Plasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.",
      "overdose_effects": "The most serious consequence of acute or chronic overdose is hypercalcaemia due to vitamin D toxicity. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, polyuria, anorexia, weakness, apathy, thirst and constipation. Chronic overdoses can lead to vascular and organ calcification as a result of hypercalcaemia. Treatment should consist of stopping all intakes of vitamin D and rehydration.",

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3RD Cef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3RD Cef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",

      "mode_of_action": "Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
      "dosage": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.For palliative management of cancer: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.Maintenance therapy: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules: Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Usual adult dose for cervical cancer: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.Intra-arterial infusion: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.Combination with radiation: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.Combination with other anticancer drugs: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",
      "interaction": "Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5 FU PhaRes following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
      "side_effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-5 FU PhaRes therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5 FU PhaRes.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5 FU PhaRes. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
      "precautions": "5-5 FU PhaRes is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools).

There is no specific antidote to 5-5 FU PhaRes toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.",

      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
      "side_effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-5-Fluril are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-5-Fluril therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5-Fluril on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5-Fluril.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5-Fluril. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
      "precautions": "5-5-Fluril is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools).

There is no specific antidote to 5-5-Fluril toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.",

Repeated use of 5X within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.Fertility Following Use: A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with 5X for emergency contraception. So, to prevent pregnancy on a later episode of sexual intercourse one should use the barrier method (ex. Condom).Effect on Menstrual Cycle: After 5X intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. 7% of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days.

      "indications": "250 mg or 500 mg tablet: Elemental A-Cal tablet is used for the treatment or prevention of calcium depletion in patients in whom dietary measures are inadequate. Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. A-Cal is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. A-Cal containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Elemental A-Cal tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
      "mode_of_action": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.",
      "dosage": "250 mg or 500 mg tablet: Calcium Carbonate is always used orally and when used as an antacid the recommended doses for adults are equivalent to 540-2000 mg Calcium Carbonate per day, doses for children being half of those for adults. As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.1000 mg tablet: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "A-Cal may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. A-Cal may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when A-Cal is used as the primary phosphate binder.",
      "contraindications": "Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Concomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level) When hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.",
      "side_effects": "Orally administered A-Cal may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in children: A-Cal has been extensively studied in children and infants with chronic renal failure and is both safe and effective.Use in elderly: In case of elderly patients with renal failure when A-Cal is taken constipation may be troublesome one for this group. For this reason, monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate is of course indicated for elderly patients.",

      "mode_of_action": "Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.",

      "interaction": "Concomitant use of A-Card with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated. Concomitant use of A-Card with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated. The vasodilating effects of A-Card may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary.",
      "contraindications": "Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Isosorbide Mononitrate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of A-Card. A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known.Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later.As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card’s antianginal efficacy.Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",
      "overdose_effects": "Symptoms: Most common symptoms are hypotension, throbbing headache, tachycardia, and flushing. Methemoglobinemia may occur with massive doses.Treatment: Treatment consists of placing patients in recumbent position and administering fluids; alpha-adrenergic vasopressors may be required.

      "indications": "Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
      "mode_of_action": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
      "dosage": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
      "contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
      "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
      "precautions": "There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",

Acute musculoskeletal disorders such as periarthritis (e.g., Frozen shoulder), tendinitis, tenosynovitis, bursitis. Other painful conditions resulting from trauma including, fracture, low back pain, sprains, strains, dislocations, control of pain and inflammation in orthopaedic, dental and other minor surgeries, postoperative pain, pain of renal colic etc. The injection also contains Lidocaine which acts as a local anaesthetic. Therefore the possibility of pain at the injection site, which is most likely to occur after intramuscular injection, is minimized if the Lidocaine containing injection is used in the above indications.",
      "mode_of_action": "Diclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic and antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric effects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",
      "dosage": "Adult: One ampoule once (or in severe cases, twice) daily by intramuscular injection.Renal colic: One ampoule once daily intramuscularly. A second dose may be administered after 30 minutes if necessary.Children: In Juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac Sodium per kg body weight daily in divided doses.Elderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status, or as prescribed by the physician.",

Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that Diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect. Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Diclofenac concomitantly. Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other. Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAIDs and quinolones. Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of Diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With Aspirin, the plasma levels of each are lowered, although no clinical significance is known. Diuretics: Various NSAIDs are liable to inhibit the activity of diuretics. Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. So, serum potassium should be monitored.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by Aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibiting activity Diclofenac is also contraindicated. Because of the presence of Lidocaine, this injection is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. In patients with Adams-Stokes syndrome or with severe degrees of SA, AV, or intraventricular heart block in the absence of an artificial pacemaker, and for those patients who are hypersensitive to any of the excipients used in the formulation (Sodium Metabisulphite, Disodium Edetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol), this injection is also contraindicated.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine injection are usually mild and transient. However if serious side effects occur the injection should be discontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very rare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In isolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may occur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadedness etc.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "It should not be prescribed during pregnancy unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy. Very small quantities of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk, but no undesirable effects on the infant are to be expected.",
      "precautions": "Renal: Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly should be kept under close observation, since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The lowest effective dose should be used and renal function should be monitored. Hepatic: If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur (eosinophilia, rash), Diclofenac should be discontinued. All patients who are receiving long term treatment with NSAIDs should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).",

      "indications": "A-Flox is indicated for the treatment of infections due to Gram-positive organisms, including infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci. These indications include: Skin and soft tissue infections: Boils, abscess, carbuncles, infected skin conditions (e.g. ulcer, eczema, acne, furunculosis, cellulitis, infected wounds, infected burns, otitis media and externa, impetigo). Respiratory tract infections: Pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, quinsy. It is also used for the treatment of other infections i.e. osteomyelitis, enteritis, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, meningitis, septicaemia caused by A-Flox-sensitive organisms. As a prophylactic agent, it is used during major surgical procedures where appropriate; for example, cardiothoracic and orthopedic surgery.",
      "mode_of_action": "Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",
      "dosage": "Oral administration: Adult: 250 mg four times daily. Dosage may be doubled in severe infections. In osteomyelitis and endocarditis, up to 8 gm daily is used in 6-8 hourly divided doses. Children (2-10 years): 1/2 of adult dose. Children (Under 2 years): 1/4 of adult dose. Parenteral administration:Adult or Elderly: Intramuscular Injection: 250 mg four times daily. Intravenous Injection: 250 mg-1 g four times daily by slow injection over 3 to 4 minutes or by intravenous infusion. All systemic doses may be doubled in severe infections: doses up to 8 g daily have been suggested for endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Children: 2-10 years: half of the adult dose.

Concomitant therapy of mucosa illnesses such as sinusitis, bronchitis, in acne vulgaris, ichthyosis, Darier's disease, psoriasis etc. To meet vitmin A demand in growth, resistance to infections and night blindness. This is also indicated to meet A-Forte deficiency after diarrhoea and prophylaxis of measles.",
      "mode_of_action": "Beta-carotene, retinol, and retinal have effective and reliable vitamin A activity. Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation.Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithe-lial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years'requirements of vitamin A. Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chy lomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin Ais stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80-300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30-70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270-753 Units per 100 mL.The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.",

      "pregnancy_cat": "Safety of amounts exceeding 6,000 Units of vitamin A daily during pregnancy has not been established at this time. The use of vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have shown fetal abnormalities associated with over-dosage in several species. Malformations of the central nervous system, the eye, the palate, and the urogenital tract are recorded. Vitamin Ain excess of the recommended dietary allowance is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If vitamin Ais used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking vitamin A, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A (5,000 Units) is recommended for nursing mothers.",

      "indications": "This kit is indicated for early Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks (63 days) of gestation.",
      "mode_of_action": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
      "dosage": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of A-Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
      "contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
      "side_effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy- Mifepristone: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- Mifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
      "precautions": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.",
      "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.",

      "side_effects": "Strongyloidiasis: In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of A-Mectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to A-Mectin. Body as a whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). Onchocerciasis: arthralgia/synovitis (19.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%), abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category C. Ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established.Nursing Mothers: Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn",
      "precautions": "Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with A-Mectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: back pain, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, or coma.",

      "indications": "A-Migel oral gel is indicated- For the treatment of oral and gastrointestinal candidiasis. For eradication of fungal colonization in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. For the treatment of super infections due to gram-positive bacteria. A-Migel cream is indicated in dermatomycoses, e.g.: Tinea pedis (Athlete's foot) Tinea corporis (Tinea circinata) Tinea manuum Tinea cruris due to: Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum audouinii, Epidermophyton floccosum Candidial infections Tinea versicolor. Infections of the skin (e.g. intertrigo) Perianal infections Stomatitis angularis (cheilitis) Balanoposthitis Otitis externa In addition miconazole cream has a very rapid alleviating effect on the pruritis which frequently accompanies infection.",
      "mode_of_action": "Pharmacodynamics: Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die.Pharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.",
      "dosage": "Miconazole Oral Gel-Oropharyngeal candidosis- Infants 4-24 months: 1.25 ml (1⁄4 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times day after meals. Adult and children 2 years of age and older: 2.5 ml (1⁄2 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times a day after meals. Gastrointestinal tract candidosis- Infants (4 months of age or above): Children and adults who have difficulty swallowing tablets: 20 mg per kg body weight per day, in four divided doses. The daily dose should not exceed 250 mg (10 ml gel) four times daily. Missed Dose: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. In case of next dosing time, omit the misseddose and continue your usual course.Miconazole Cream: Sufficient Miconazole Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and cutaneous candidiasis and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If Miconazole Cream is used in intertriginous areas it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun.All lesions usually disappear after 2 to 5 weeks.Prolong treatment for 10 days to prevent relapse. However, Candida infections, tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.",
      "interaction": "Concomitant treatment with Terfenadine, Astemizole and Cisapride should be avoided because in vitro studies suggest that A-Migel may inhibit their metabolism, so these products miqht precipitated.

      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

The combination is used in steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or arisk of bacterial ocular infection exists. The combination can also be used for post-operative inflammation and any other ocular inflammation associated with infection.Ear: A-Phenicol D is indicated in otitis externa, otitis media and chronic suppurative otitis media.",
      "mode_of_action": "Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid. It has an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic action. It is used topically in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the anterior segment of the eye. Dexamethasone is absorbed rapidly after oral administration with a half-life of about 190 minutes. Sufficient absorption may occur after topical application to the skin and eye to produce systemic effects.Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic active against a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Chloramphenicol exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage",

Corneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of comeal ulcer is 2 drops in the affected eye (s) every 15 minutes for the first 6 hours then 2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 30 minutes for the remainder of first day. On the second day, instill 2 drops in the affected eye (s) hourly. On the 3 to 14 days, place 2 drops in the affected eye (s) every 4 hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred. Ear: For all infections, 2 to 3 drops every 2 to 3 hours initially. Frequency should be decreased gradually as warranted by improvement in clinical signs. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely.",
      "interaction": "If Chloramphenicol is absorbed from eye when taking anticoagulants e.g. warfarin, there may be an increase in the effect of this medicine. Action of Chloramphenicol will be inhibited if given simultaneously with Phenobarbital. The therapeutic efficacy of Dexamethasone may be reduced with the concomitant administration of phenytoin, phenobarbitone, ephedrine and rifampicin.",

Myelosuppression during previous exposure to Chloramphenicol. Hypersensitivity to Chloramphenicol & Dexamethasone Phosphate or to any other ingredients of the preparations.",
      "side_effects": "Adverse reactions seen with Chloramphenicol are transient ocular burning or discomfort and other reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred vision, dryness and eye pain. Allergic sensitization may occur with the local use of Chloramphenicol. Elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma, infrequent optic nerve damage and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.",

      "indications": "A-Statin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and triglycerides levels in following diseases when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate. To reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. To reduce elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in patient with mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ia and Ib). For the treatment of patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridaemia (Fredrickson Type IV). For the treatment of patients with dysbetalipoproteinaemia (Fredrickson Type III). To reduce cardiac ischaemic events in patients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate symptomatic coronary artery disease with elevated LDL-cholesterol level. To reduce total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with or exacerbated by diabetes mellitus or renal transplantation.",
      "mode_of_action": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
      "dosage": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia- Adults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily. Child (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily. Familial hypercholesterolaemia- Adults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia). Child (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily. Prevention of cardiovascular events- Adults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response. Another guideline: The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",
      "interaction": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.Warfarin: A-Statin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.",
      "contraindications": "Atorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",
      "side_effects": "A-Statin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to A-Statin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnantLactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.",
      "precautions": "Liver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. A-Statin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. A-Statin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of A-Statin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.Gender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with A-Statin between men and women.Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of A-Statin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of A-Statin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of A-Statin are markedly increased.",
      "overdose_effects": "Specific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.",

      "mode_of_action": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
      "dosage": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",

Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
      "contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",

Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",

The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.",
      "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.",

      "mode_of_action": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

      "indications": "Abac is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These include- Undesirable Upper respiratory tract infections: sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngo-tracheo bronchitis and otitis media, and also Lower respiratory tract infections: bronchitis (acute and chronic), lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Urinary tract infections: cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis. Skin and soft tissue infections: abscess, cellulitis, furunculosis and impetigo. The following microorganisms are susceptible, in vitro to Abac: Gram-positive: Staphylococci (both penicillin sensitive and resistant strains and penicillinase-producing species), Streptococci, Streptococci pyogenes (beta haemolytic), Streptococcus pneumonia. Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Shigella spp, Salmonella spp (including Salmonella typhi), Neisseria spp Many strains of E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus that produce the enzyme penicillinase and thus are ampicillin resistant, are susceptible to Abac which is unaffected by this enzyme.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.",
      "dosage": "For oral administration-Adults: Urinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required. Respiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection. Skin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection. Children: Total daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses. Otitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly. Maximum daily dosage: 4 gm Elderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.For injectable administration- Adult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given. Children: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.",
      "interaction": "The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.",
      "contraindications": "Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.",
      "side_effects": "Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema. Blood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia) Immune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis Psychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances Nervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache Hepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis Investigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.",
      "precautions": "Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms. Abac should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics. Cephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs’ testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug. Abac may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix). Dosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment. Abac contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Renal Impairment: The following doses are recommended (based on 500 mg every 6 hours) for patients not on haemodialysis: CrCl: >20 ml/min: 500 mg every 6 hours CrCl: 5-20 ml/min: 250 mg every 6 hours CrCl: <5 ml/min: 250 mg every 50-70 hours. Recommendations for patients on chronic, intermittent haemodialysis: 250 mg at the start of haemodialysis 250 mg 6 to 12 hours after the start 250 mg 36 to 48 hours after the start 250 mg at the start of the next haemodialysis session if more than 30 hours have elapsed since the last dose. Additional Information for all patients Regardless of patient age or weight, higher doses of up to 1 gm four times daily may be required for infections which are chronic or severe. Treatment should continue for at least 2 to 3 days after symptoms have resolved or bacteria have been eradicated. To reduce the possibility of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis resulting from infections with haemolytic streptococci, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Throughout treatment of chronic urinary tract infections and for several months thereafter, regular bacteriological and clinical monitoring is required. Doses below those recommended above should not be prescribed. Paediatric dosages should not exceed those specified for adults, regardless of severity of infection. It may be necessary to continue Abac therapy for several weeks in persistent infections. Patients may be transferred from intramuscular/intravenous Abac therapy to oral treatment at the same dosage level.",
      "overdose_effects": "The symptoms of Sefrad overdose are non-specific and are generally nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastric upsets. Treatment is mainly supportive although gastric lavage will be necessary if a large amount has been ingested.",

      "indications": "Abacten is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Abacten is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
      "mode_of_action": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity. Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
      "dosage": "Oral-Adult: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.Children: 10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months 200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg 300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg. In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given. Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only): The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin. Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.",
      "interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Abacten and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. Terfenadine: Abacten did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
      "contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
      "side_effects": "Abacten is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
      "precautions": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in renal impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.Use in hepatic impairment: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.",
      "overdose_effects": "There is no data on overdosage with Abacten. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.",

      "mode_of_action": "Insulin Glargine is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as a subcutaneous injection. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action), parenteral blood glucose lowering agent. Insulin Glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology. Primary function of insulin glargine is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose by stimulation peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.",
      "dosage": "Insulin Glargine exhibits a relatively constant glucose-lowering profile over 24 hours that permits once-daily dosing. Potency of insulin glargine is approximately the same as human insulin.Insulin Glargine is recommended for once daily subcutaneous administration & may be administered at any time during the day. However, once started should be administered at the same time every day. The dose of Insulin Glargine must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients with diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine must be used in regimens with short-acting insulin. Insulin Glargine is not recommended for intravenous administration. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia.Initiation of Insulin Glargine therapy: The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 10 units (or 0.2 Units/kg) once daily, which should subsequently be adjusted to the patient's needs. Converting to Insulin Glargine from other insulin therapies: If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate-or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Insulin Glargine , the amount and timing of shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be adjusted. If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine , the recommended initial Insulin Glargine dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued. If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine , the recommended initial Insulin Glargine dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued.",
      "interaction": "A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment. The following substances may reduce the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements: Oral anti-diabetic products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.The following substances may increase the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements: Thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin.",
      "contraindications": "Insulin glargine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or any of its excipients.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Abasaglar are hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash.",

Gently turn the pen upside down for 8-10 times until the insulin in the cartridge becomes uniformly mixed. Adjust the dosage button to get correct dose. After removal of the needle cap and discharge air bubbles in the cartridge, it is ready to be injected. In order to avoid cross contamination, do not let the needle touch anything during the process of preparation. Vial: Firstly, clean your hands. Shake or rotate the vial gently to mix the solution uniformly and check if the insulin has the normal appearance. If using a new Insulin Glargine bottle then flip off the plastic protective cap and wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Draw air into your syringe equal to the amount of Insulin Glargine needed. Puncture the needle into the vial and inject the air. Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Withdraw correct dose of Insulin Glargine into the syringe. Before pulling out the needle, check if there are any bubbles remain in the syringe. If so, put the syringe upright and tap the syringe to discharge the air bubbles. Injection Site: Choose the area where skin is less tight, such as the upper arm, thigh, buttock and abdomen, etc. To avoid tissue damage, choose a site for each injection that is at least 1 cm from the previous injection site.Injection Method: Cleanse the skin with alcohol where the injection is to be made. Put the needle in such a position as to form 45° angle with the skin. Puncture the needle into skin and inject insulin. Then pull the needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injected site for several seconds. Do not rub the injection site."

Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
      "mode_of_action": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
      "contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
      "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",

      "mode_of_action": "Sodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant laxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria and acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis with promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the colonic lumen. This results in stimulation of defecation, reduction of transit time and softening of the stool. Stimulation of the rectum causes increased motility and a feeling of rectal fullness. The rectal effect may help to restore the \"call to stool\".",

The dose may be adjusted up to the maximum recommended dose to produce regular stools. The maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded:10 mg tablet dose: Adults and children over 10 years of age: 5-10 mg per day. Children aged 4-10 years: 2.5-5 mg per day. Oral Solution (5 mg/5 ml) dose: Adults and children over 10 years of age: 5-10 ml or one to two teaspoonful per day. Children aged 4-10 years: 2.5-5 ml or half to one teaspoonful per day.

      "mode_of_action": "Sodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant laxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria and acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis with promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the colonic lumen. This results in stimulation of defecation, reduction of transit time and softening of the stool. Stimulation of the rectum causes increased motility and a feeling of rectal fullness. The rectal effect may help to restore the \"call to stool\".",

Chemically, it is [Bicyclohexyl-]1-carboxylic acid, 2-(diethylammo) ethyl ester, hydrochloride. Dicycloverine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Dicycloverine HCl Injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, aqueous solution for intramuscular injection (Not For Intravenous Use). It works at specific receptors, called cholinergic (or muscarinic) receptors, located on the involuntary muscle in the walls of the gut. By binding to these receptors dicycloverine prevents certain chemicals produced by the body from interacting with these receptors. This causes the gut muscle to relax, relieving the pain of colic produced by gut muscle contraction and spasm.",

      "indications": "Abecab is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. This is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.",
      "mode_of_action": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",
      "dosage": "Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.",
      "interaction": "The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2nd and 3rd trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",

      "indications": "Aben-DS is indicated in single and mixed infestations of- Hookworm (Ancylostoma, Necator) Roundworm (Ascaris) Threadworm (Enterobius) Whipworm (Trichuris) Strongyloides Tapeworm Opisthorchi Hydatid.",
      "mode_of_action": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",
      "dosage": "Adults & children over 2 years: 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. Children of 1-2 years: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).Children under 1 year: Not recommended.In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis): Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg. A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg. For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles. For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years. In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.",
      "interaction": "No interaction involving Aben-DS, either pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, has been reported.",
      "contraindications": "Neonates: Albendazole is not normally used in neonates.Children: Reduction of the dose from 400 mg to 200 mg may be indicated in children weighing less than 10 kg but there are no grounds for a general reduction in dosage to children.Pregnant woman: Albendazole should not be given during pregnancy or women thought to be pregnant. No information is available on placental transfer.Concurrent disease: There is no evidence to suggest that dose should be altered in renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.",
      "side_effects": "Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease.",

      "indications": "Abetis tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
      "mode_of_action": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",
      "dosage": "Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",
      "interaction": "No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.",
      "contraindications": "Olmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
      "side_effects": "Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "When pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "precautions": "As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.",
      "overdose_effects": "There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered.

Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant.

Abicon can also be used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux during concomitant treatment with or following the withdrawal of acid suppressing therapy.",
      "mode_of_action": "This is the combination of Sodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate. Sodium Alginate is a naturally occurring substance. It reacts with the acid in the stomach to form a gel. Potassium Bicarbonate also reacts with the acid in the stomach to form bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles are trapped by the gel formed by Sodium Alginate and they allow the gel to float like a raft on top of the stomach contents. The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.",

The suspension work in two ways- Neutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort Forming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest. The mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

      "indications": "Abiraxen is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).",
      "mode_of_action": "Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",
      "dosage": "Recommended Dose For Metastatic CRPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Recommended Dose For Metastatic High-Risk CSPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg administered orally once daily. Patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or at least two hours atier a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets.Dose Modification: For patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the Abiraterone Acetate starting dose to 250 mg once daily. For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued. Or, as directed by the registered physician. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "interaction": "Drugs That Inhibit Or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes: Based on in vitro data, Abiraxen is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of Abiraxen by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during Abiraxen treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraxen dosing frequency. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of Abiraxen.Effects Of Abiraxen On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Abiraxen is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when Dextromethorphan was given with Abiraxen 1,000 mg daily and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of Abiraxen with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiraxen. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Abiraxen.",

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      "mode_of_action": "Persistent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in Central Nervous System by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels.Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. The hepatic microsomal CYP-450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of Memantine.",
      "dosage": "The recommended maintenance dose of Memantine for adults and older patients is 20 mg every day. In order to lower the risk of side effects, the dose should be achieved by upward titration with 5 mg per week over 3 weeks, achieving the maintenance dose of 20 mg/day from the start of week 4 according to the following dosage guideline:Week 1 (Everyday): Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- No doseWeek 2 (Everyday): Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)Week 3 (Everyday): Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)Week 4 and onwards (Everyday): Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 10 mg (2 tablets)Missed Dose: If any dose is missed, just wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose to compensate for the missed dose.In case renal impairment: In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes). If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes) per day.In case of hepatic impairment: In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function, no dosage adjustment is needed. Administration of memantine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Children under 18 years: Memantine is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.",
      "interaction": "Due to the pharmacological effects and mechanism of action of memantine suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of mematine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dosage adjustment may be necessary. Abixa should not be used with amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan, phenytoin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinidine, quinine & nicotine.",

      "side_effects": "Most frequent side effects (frequency of 2% or less) include hallucination, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. Occasional side effects include anxiety, hypertonus (heightened muscle tension), vomiting, bladder infections and increased sexual drive. If there is a history of epileptic seizures, there is a slight chance that Abixa may increase the probability of an attack.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category B. Yet there are no adequate and well controlled studies of Memantine in pregnant women. Memantine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Memantine is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Memantine is administered to a nursing mother.",
      "precautions": "Caregivers should be instructed in the recommended administration (twice per day for doses above 5 mg) and dose escalation (minimum interval of one week between dose increases). If the patients suffer from kidney dysfunction, the kidney function should be monitored at regular basis.Seizures: Abixa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. One clinical trial shows that seizures occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with Abixa and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Study shows that no risk of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility are caused after Abixa use.Operating Vehicles or Machinery: Taking Abixa may alter the reaction time significantly; therefore safe driving and safe operation of machinery may no longer be possible.",

      "mode_of_action": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
      "dosage": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of ABO Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
      "contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
      "side_effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",

Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- Mifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
      "precautions": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.",
      "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.",

Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.",
      "mode_of_action": "Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations of Misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of Misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 meg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of Misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.",

      "indications": "This eye drop is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",
      "mode_of_action": "This eye drops is comprised of two components: Brimonidine Tartrate & Timolol Maleate. Brimonidine Tartrate is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist having a dual mechanism of action. It decreases aqueous humor production and increases nonpressure dependent uveoscleral outflow. Timolol Maleate is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. It lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. Therefore the combination of both drugs gives a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen within two hours of administration.",
      "dosage": "Instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily.",
      "interaction": "Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted.",
      "contraindications": "Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Also contraindicated in bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock.",
      "side_effects": "The most common side effects are allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye pruritus and ocular burning or stinging.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Combipres should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Timolol has been detected in human milk but it is not known whether Brimonidine Tartrate is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "precautions": "Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents, it may be absorbed systemically. Due to the presence of Timolol, the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-blockers may occur. Cautions should be exercised in treating patients with severe or unstable and uncontrolled cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.",

      "mode_of_action": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",
      "dosage": "Adults & children over 2 years: 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. Children of 1-2 years: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).Children under 1 year: Not recommended.In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis): Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg. A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg. For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles. For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years. In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.",

      "mode_of_action": "Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, acalabrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.",
      "dosage": "The recommended dose of Acalabrutinib is 100 mg taken orally approximately every twelve hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Advise patients to swallow capsule whole with water. Advise patients not to open, break or chew the capsules. Acalabrutinib may be taken with or without food. If a dose of Acalabrutinib is missed by more than 3 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at its regularly scheduled time. Extra capsules of Acalabrutinib should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.Recommended Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions: Dosage of Acalabrutinib can be reduced up to 100 mg daily for the toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level. If the adverse reaction occurrence more than four times Acalabrutinib can be Discontinue.",
      "interaction": "Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Acaluxen: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (200 mg Iitraconazole once daily for 5 days) increased the Acaluxen Cmax by 3.9-fold and AUC by 5.1-fold in healthy subjects. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations with Acaluxen and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem) showed that co-administration increased Acaluxen Cmax and AUC increased by 2- to almost 3-fold.Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Acaluxen: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampin once daily for 9 days) decreased Acaluxen Cmax by 68% and AUC by 77% in healthy subjects.Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: Acaluxen solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration with an antacid (1 g calcium carbonate) decreased Acaluxen AUC by 53% in healthy subjects. Co-administration with a proton pump inhibitor (40 mg omeprazole for 5 days) decreased Acaluxen AUC by 43%.In Vitro Studies-Metabolic Pathways: Acaluxen is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. The active metabolite (ACP-5862) is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. Acaluxen is a weak inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4; the active metabolite (ACP-5862) weakly induces CYP3A4. Based on in vitro data and PBPK modeling, no interaction with CYP substrates is expected at clinically relevant concentrations.Drug Transporter Systems: Acaluxen is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Acaluxen is not a substrate of renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, or hepatic transporters OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Acaluxen does not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Acaluxen may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by inhibition of intestinal BCRP.",
      "side_effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) were: anemia, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, headache, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy: Based on findings in animals, Acalabrutinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Acalabrutinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in reduced fetal growth at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Lactation: No data are available regarding the presence of Acalabrutinib or its active metabolite in human milk, its effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. Due to the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Acalabrutinib, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking Acalabrutinib and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose.",
      "precautions": "Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events, including gastrointestinal, intracranial, and epistaxis have been reported in 2% of patients. Overall, bleeding events including bruising and petechiae of any grade occurred in approximately 50% of patients with hematological malignancies. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Acaluxen may further increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Acaluxen for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.Infection: Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events and opportunistic infections have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy. Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 18% of these patients. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and progressive multifocaln leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate. Cytopenias: In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies, patients treated with Acaluxen monotherapy experienced Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (11%) and thrombocytopenia (8%) based on laboratory measurements. In the Acaluxen clinical Trial LY-004, patients’ complete blood counts were assessed monthly during treatment.Second Primary Malignancies: Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinomas, have occurred in 11% of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy in the combined safety database of 612 patients. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer, reported in 7% of patients. Advise protection from sun exposure.Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter: In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade occurred in 3% of patients, and Grade 3 in 1% of patients. Monitor for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Renal Impairment: Acaluxen undergoes minimal renal elimination. Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in 368 patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). Acaluxen PK has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <29 mL/min/1.73m2, MDRD) or renal impairment requiring dialysis.Hepatic Impairment: Acaluxen is metabolized in the liver. In a hepatic impairment study, compared to subjects with normal liver function (n=6), Acaluxen exposure (AUC) was increased by less than two-fold in subjects with mild (n=6) (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (n=6) (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, respectively. Based on a population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in subjects with mild (n=41) or moderate (n=3) hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST) relative to subjects with normal (n=527) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN). Acaluxen PK has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C or total bilirubin between 3 and 10 times ULN and any AST).Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of Acaluxen in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric Use: Eighty (64.5%) of the 124 MCL patients in clinical trials of Acaluxen were 65 years of age or older, and 32 patients (25.8%) were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.",

      "indications": "Acaril is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
      "mode_of_action": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
      "dosage": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose should be adjusted at 4–8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
      "interaction": "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acaril, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acaril in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acaril therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.",
      "contraindications": "Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
      "side_effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acaril when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acaril was added to metformin therapy.Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by Acaril, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by Acaril, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: safety and effectiveness of Acaril in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric Use: of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Acaril in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.",
      "overdose_effects": "Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose of Acaril will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort which shortly subside. In cases of overdosage the patient should not be given drinks or meals containing carbohydrates (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and disaccharides) for the next 4–6 hours.",

      "indications": "Accuzith is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Accuzith is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
      "mode_of_action": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity. Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
      "dosage": "Oral-Adult: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.Children: 10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months 200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg 300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg. In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given. Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only): The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin. Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.",
      "interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Accuzith and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. Terfenadine: Accuzith did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
      "contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
      "side_effects": "Accuzith is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
      "precautions": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in renal impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.Use in hepatic impairment: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.",
      "overdose_effects": "There is no data on overdosage with Accuzith. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.",

      "indications": "Ace is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",
      "dosage": "Tablet: Adult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily. Children (6-12 years): ½ to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily. For long term treatment it is wise not to exceed the dose beyond 2.6 gm/day. Extended Release Tablet: Adults & Children over 12 years: Two tablets, swallowed whole, every 6 to 8 hours (maximum of 6 tablets in any 24 hours).The tablet must not be crushed. Syrup/Suspension: Children under 3 months: 10 mg/kg body weight (reduce to 5 mg/kg if jaundiced) 3 to 4 times daily. 3 months to below 1 year: ½ to 1 teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. 1-5 years: 1 -2 teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. 6-12 years: 2-A teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. Adults: 4-8 teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. Suppository: Children 3-12 months: 60-120 mg,4 times daily. Children 1-5 years: 125-250 mg 4 times daily. Children 6-12 years: 250-500 mg 4 times daily. Adults & children over 12 years: 0.5-1 gm 4 times daily. Paediatric Drop: Children Upto 3 months: 0.5 ml (40 mg) 4 to 11 months: 1.0 ml (80 mg) 7 to 2 years: 1.5 ml (120 mg). Do not exceed more than 5 dose daily for a maximum of 5 days. Tablet with actizorb technology: It dissolves up to five times faster than standard Paracetamol tablets. It is a fast acting and safe analgesic with marked antipyretic property. It is specially suitable for patients who, for any reason, can not tolerate aspirin or other analgesics. Adults and children (aged 12 years and over): Take 1 to 2 Tablets every four to six hours as needed. Do not take more than 8 caplets in 24 hours. Children (7 to 11 years): Take ½-1 Tablet every four to six hours as needed. Do not take more than 4 caplets in 24 hours. Not recommended in children under 7 years. IV Infusion: Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Paracetamol IV is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of Paracetamol IV of 1000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of Paracetamol of 4000 mg per day. Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of Paracetamol IV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of Paracetamol IV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of Paracetamol of 75 mg/kg per day. Children >2 to 12 years of age: the recommended dosage of Paracetamol IV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of Paracetamol IV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of Paracetamol of 75 mg/kg per day.",
      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace Power overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace Power overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace Power concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace Power. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",
      "dosage": "Tablet: Adult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily. Children (6-12 years): ½ to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace XR. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Ace XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Ace XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace XR-containing products concurrently. Ace XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Ace XR in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace XR. Use caution when administering Ace XR in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace XR IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace XR IV in patients with Ace XR allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Ace XR IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace XR IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Ace XR is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace XR may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace XR may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

      "indications": "Acecard tablet indicated in the following cases: Hypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Congestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics. Treatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure. Treatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy. Reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).",
      "mode_of_action": "Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.",
      "dosage": "Dosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily. Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.Dosage in renal impairment: For patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily. For patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.",
      "interaction": "Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Acecard and cause deterioration of renal function.",
      "contraindications": "Ramipril must not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril. in patients with a history of angioedema. concomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body. in patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney. in patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states. with aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min). with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy. during pregnancy. Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.",
      "side_effects": "Acecard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.",
      "precautions": "Acecard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Elderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Acecard daily must be considered.Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Acecard.Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Acecard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Acecard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Acecard daily must be considered.Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Acecard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Acecard.",
      "overdose_effects": "Sign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of α1-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.",

It is effective in the prevention of stress ulceration and GI bleeding. It acts as an antiflatulent to alleviate the symptoms of gas including post operative gas pain. This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air.",
      "mode_of_action": "This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.",
      "dosage": "Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. Antacids decrease the bioavailability of theophyline, tetracycline, quinolone antibiotics, isoniazide, ketoconazole, ethambutol, some antimuscarinic drugs, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, ranitidine, indomethacine, nitrofurantoin, fluoride, phosphate, propanolol, atenolol, digoxins, vitamins etc. Antacids increase the bioavailability of some drugs; e.g. sulphonamides, levodopa, valproic acid, enteric coated aspirin etc.",
      "contraindications": "This should not be administered in patients with renal failure or hypophosphataemia or in those who are severely debilitated. It is also contraindicated in alkalosis and hypermagnesaemia, where abdominal distention may be due to partial or complete intestinal obstruction.",

      "indications": "Acefra is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These include- Undesirable Upper respiratory tract infections: sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngo-tracheo bronchitis and otitis media, and also Lower respiratory tract infections: bronchitis (acute and chronic), lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Urinary tract infections: cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis. Skin and soft tissue infections: abscess, cellulitis, furunculosis and impetigo. The following microorganisms are susceptible, in vitro to Acefra: Gram-positive: Staphylococci (both penicillin sensitive and resistant strains and penicillinase-producing species), Streptococci, Streptococci pyogenes (beta haemolytic), Streptococcus pneumonia. Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Shigella spp, Salmonella spp (including Salmonella typhi), Neisseria spp Many strains of E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus that produce the enzyme penicillinase and thus are ampicillin resistant, are susceptible to Acefra which is unaffected by this enzyme.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.",
      "dosage": "For oral administration-Adults: Urinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required. Respiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection. Skin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection. Children: Total daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses. Otitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly. Maximum daily dosage: 4 gm Elderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.For injectable administration- Adult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given. Children: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.",
      "interaction": "The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.",
      "contraindications": "Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.",
      "side_effects": "Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema. Blood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia) Immune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis Psychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances Nervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache Hepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis Investigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.",
      "precautions": "Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms. Acefra should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics. Cephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs’ testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug. Acefra may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix). Dosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment. Acefra contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Renal Impairment: The following doses are recommended (based on 500 mg every 6 hours) for patients not on haemodialysis: CrCl: >20 ml/min: 500 mg every 6 hours CrCl: 5-20 ml/min: 250 mg every 6 hours CrCl: <5 ml/min: 250 mg every 50-70 hours. Recommendations for patients on chronic, intermittent haemodialysis: 250 mg at the start of haemodialysis 250 mg 6 to 12 hours after the start 250 mg 36 to 48 hours after the start 250 mg at the start of the next haemodialysis session if more than 30 hours have elapsed since the last dose. Additional Information for all patients Regardless of patient age or weight, higher doses of up to 1 gm four times daily may be required for infections which are chronic or severe. Treatment should continue for at least 2 to 3 days after symptoms have resolved or bacteria have been eradicated. To reduce the possibility of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis resulting from infections with haemolytic streptococci, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Throughout treatment of chronic urinary tract infections and for several months thereafter, regular bacteriological and clinical monitoring is required. Doses below those recommended above should not be prescribed. Paediatric dosages should not exceed those specified for adults, regardless of severity of infection. It may be necessary to continue Acefra therapy for several weeks in persistent infections. Patients may be transferred from intramuscular/intravenous Acefra therapy to oral treatment at the same dosage level.",
      "overdose_effects": "The symptoms of Sefrad overdose are non-specific and are generally nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastric upsets. Treatment is mainly supportive although gastric lavage will be necessary if a large amount has been ingested.",

      "mode_of_action": "Cephalexin is a semisynthetic analogue of Cephalosporin C. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with mechanical stability. The final stage in the synthesis of peptidoglycan involves the completion of the cross-linking and the terminal glycine residue of the Pentaglycine Bridge is linked to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (d-alanin). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by penicillins and cephalosporins. As a result the bacterial cell wall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Cephalexin is a first generation cephalosporin that is active by mouth.",

This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. So, Acetazolamide is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of epilepsy.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Acep. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Acep overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Acep levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Acep are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",

Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Acep to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Acep-containing products concurrently. Acep should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Acep in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Acep. Use caution when administering Acep in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Acep IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Acep IV in patients with Acep allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Acep IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Acep IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Acep is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Acep. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Acep may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

      "indications": "Aceril tablet indicated in the following cases: Hypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Congestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics. Treatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure. Treatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy. Reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).",
      "mode_of_action": "Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.",
      "dosage": "Dosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily. Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.Dosage in renal impairment: For patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily. For patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.",
      "interaction": "Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Aceril and cause deterioration of renal function.",
      "contraindications": "Ramipril must not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril. in patients with a history of angioedema. concomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body. in patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney. in patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states. with aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min). with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy. during pregnancy. Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.",
      "side_effects": "Aceril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.",
      "precautions": "Aceril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Elderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Aceril daily must be considered.Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Aceril.Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Aceril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Aceril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Aceril daily must be considered.Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Aceril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Aceril.",
      "overdose_effects": "Sign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of α1-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.",

      "mode_of_action": "Acyclovir exerts its antiviral e­ects on Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with Herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Acyclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Acyclovir Triphosphate. Acyclovir is converted to Acyclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase, the monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via other cellular enzymes to the Triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug.",
      "dosage": "Herpes simplex infection: For normal or immunocompromised immune status: 5 mg/kg every 8 hours Very severe Herpes zoster infection (shingles): For normal immune status: 5 mg/kg every 8 hours Varicella zoster infection: For immunocompromised immune status: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours Herpes simplex encephalitis: For normal or immunocompromised immune status: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours Each dose should be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a one-hour period.",

Urinary excretion and renal clearance correspondingly reduced. In patients over 60 years of age concurrent use of diuretics increases plasma levels of Acerux very significantly.",
      "contraindications": "Acyclovir IV Injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to Acyclovir or Valacyclovir.",
      "side_effects": "Some infrequent adverse reactions are lethargy, obtundation, tremors, confusion, hallucinations, agitation, somnolence, psychosis, convulsions and coma, phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, reversible increases in liver-related enzymes, pruritus, urticaria, rashes, increases in blood urea and creatinine. Local inflammatory reactions may occur if Acerux IV Infusion is inadvertently infused into extracellular tissues.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy category B. There have been no adequate and well controlled studies concerning the safety of Acyclovir in pregnant women. It should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the patient clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Acyclovir should only be administered to nursing mothers if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the baby. There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.",
      "precautions": "Acerux IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acerux IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acerux IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acerux IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine ‑ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acerux. As Acerux has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric use: The dose of Acerux IV injection in children aged 1-12 years should be calculated on the basis of body surface area. Children in this age group with Herpes simplex infections (except Herpes simplex encephalitis) or Varicella zoster infections should be given Acerux IV Infusion in doses of 250 mg/m2 (equivalent to 5 mg/kg in adults). Immunocompromised children in this age group with Varicella zoster virus infection or with Herpes simplex encephalitis should be given Acerux IV Infusion in doses of 500 mg/m2 (equivalent to 10 mg/kg in adults). Children with impaired renal function require an appropriately modified dose, according to the degree of impairment. Geriatric use: No data are available on this age group. However, as creatinine clearance is often low in the elderly, special attention should be given to dosage reduction.In patients with renal impairment: Acerux should be administered with caution since the drug is excreted through the kidneys. The following modifications in dosage are suggested: CrCl: 25-50 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 12 hours CrCl: 10-25 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours CrCl: 0-10 ml/min: 2.5 or 5 mg/kg every 24 hours and after dialysis.",
      "overdose_effects": "Overdosage of intravenous Acerux has resulted in elevations of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and subsequent renal failure. Neurological effects including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, seizures and coma have been described in association with over dosage. Adequate hydration is essential to reduce the possibility of crystal formation in the urine. Hemodialysis significantly enhances the removal of Acerux from the blood and may, therefore, be considered an option in the management of overdose of Acerux.",

The inhibitory activity of Acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Acyclovir into Acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: Competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase Incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain Inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.

      "mode_of_action": "Vitamin A is essential for human health. Vitamin A is highly important for vision, cell development and immunity. Vitamin A's role on immunity contributes to its anti-cancer properties.Vitamin C is one of the most widely taken supplements and plays a primary role in the formation of collagen, which is important for the growth and repair of cells, gums, blood vessels, bones and teeth. Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems.Manganese, an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). SOD is an enzyme that protect against cell damaging free radicals.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Aceta are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",

      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Aceta to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-containing products concurrently. Aceta should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Aceta in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta. Use caution when administering Aceta in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta IV in patients with Aceta allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Aceta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Aceta overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Aceta Extend should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Aceta Extend in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta Extend. Use caution when administering Aceta Extend in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta Extend IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta Extend IV in patients with Aceta Extend allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta Extend IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta Extend IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Aceta Extend is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta Extend may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta Extend may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta Extend. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta Extend may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Aceta Extend overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta Extend overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta Extend concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta Extend. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta-PD. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta-PD overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta-PD levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Aceta-PD are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Aceta-PD to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-PD-containing products concurrently. Aceta-PD should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Aceta-PD in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta-PD. Use caution when administering Aceta-PD in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta-PD IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta-PD IV in patients with Aceta-PD allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta-PD IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta-PD IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Aceta-PD is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta-PD may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta-PD may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta-PD. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta-PD may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Aceta-PD overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta-PD overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta-PD concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta-PD. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

      "indications": "Aceten is indicated as an adjuvant treatment in certain clinical condition characterized by the presence of thick and viscous mucoid or mucopurulent secretions such as: Chronic bronchopulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema with bronchitis, chronic asthmatic bronchitis, bronchiectasis); Acute bronchopulmonary diseases (asthma with bronchial mucus plugging, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis, pulmonary complications associated with surgery).",
      "mode_of_action": "Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that reduces the viscosity of secretions probably by the splitting of disulphide bonds in mucoproteins. Moreover it gives antisecretory effect. These results in clearing of respiratory ducts and facilitate breathing. Acetylcysteine also has anti-oxidant properties by reacting with free radicals and also by serving as a precursor to glutathione, which is an important intra and extra-cellular antioxidant. By providing anti-oxidant action, it neutralizes exogenous and endogenous oxidants, which in fact act as pathogens in respiratory inflammations.",
      "dosage": "Effervescent tablet or Dispersible tablet: Adults and children above 6 years: One effervescent tablet of Acetylcysteine 600 mg a day (preferably in the evening). The duration of treatment should be 5 to 10 days in the acute treatment, whereas it may be continued in the chronic states for several months, according to the advice of the physician. Dissolve the tablets in a glass containing a small quantity of water, mixing it, if necessary, with a spoon. A palatable solution is thus obtained, which can be drunk directly from the glass.Effervescent Granules: Adults and children above 6 years: 1 sachet Acetylcysteine 200 mg or 2 sachets Acetylcysteine 100 mg, 2-3 times a day. Children (2-6 years of age): 1 sachet Acetylcysteine 100 mg from 2 to 4 times a day, according to the age. The duration of treatment should be 5 to 10 days in the acute treatment, whereas it may be continued in the chronic states for several months, according to the advice of the physician.Dissolve the contents of the sachets in a glass containing a small quantity of water; mixing it, if necessary, with a spoon. A palatable solution is thus obtained, which can be drunk directly from the glass.Nebuliser Solution: The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride for injection, Sodium Chloride for inhalation, sterile water for injection, or sterile water for inhalation. Adult: 5-10 ml of 10% or 20% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN. Children: 1-11 months: 1-2 ml of 20% or 2-4 ml of 10% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN. 12 months-11 years: 3-5 ml of 20% or 6-10 ml of 10% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN. Below 12 years: 5-10 ml of 10/20% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN. ** Diagnostic Bronchograms: 1-2 ml of 20% or 2-4 ml of 10% solution 2-3 times by Nebulisation or by instillation intratracheally prior to procedure.** Nebulisation tent or croupette: This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 ml during a single treatment period. If a tent or croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable.** Direct Instillation: When used by direct instillation, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given every 1-4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy.",
      "interaction": "The thiol group of Aceten can reduce the efficacy of certain antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, macrolides, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and amphotericin. Concomitant use of Aceten and amoxicillin will increase the level of the antibiotic in tissues. It is, therefore, advisable to use the two medicines 2 hours apart from each other. Aceten can increase the inhibitory effect of thrombocyte aggregation and vasodialation by nitroglycerine.",
      "contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to Acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine contains aspartame, thus it is contraindicated in patients suffering from phenylketonuria.",
      "side_effects": "Like all medicines, Aceten can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In very rare cases, severe immune reactions may occur such as anaphylactic shock and severe skin reaction. In rare cases the oral administration can be followed by shortness of breath, upset stomach and bronchospasm. The most frequent side effects are headache, increased heart rate, stomatitis, pruritus, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, decrease in the blood pressure, diarrhoea and noises in the ears.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "In case of pregnancy & lactation the medicine should be taken consulting physician or pharmacist.",
      "precautions": "Patients suffering from bronchial asthma must be strictly controlled during the therapy; should bronchospasm occur, the treatment must immediately be suspended. Caution should be taken in patients suffering from or with a history of peptic ulcer. As Viscotin contains sodium (156.9mg per dose) this has to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. The possible presence of a sulphureous odor does not indicate an alteration of the product but is a characteristic of the active ingredient contained in Aceten. It is preferable not to mix other drugs with the Viscotin solution.",

      "indications": "Aceto is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",
      "dosage": "Tablet: Adult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily. Children (6-12 years): ½ to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily. For long term treatment it is wise not to exceed the dose beyond 2.6 gm/day. Extended Release Tablet: Adults & Children over 12 years: Two tablets, swallowed whole, every 6 to 8 hours (maximum of 6 tablets in any 24 hours).The tablet must not be crushed. Syrup/Suspension: Children under 3 months: 10 mg/kg body weight (reduce to 5 mg/kg if jaundiced) 3 to 4 times daily. 3 months to below 1 year: ½ to 1 teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. 1-5 years: 1 -2 teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily. 6-12 years: 2-A teaspoonful 3 to 4 times daily.

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceto. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceto overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceto levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Aceto are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",

Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Aceto to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceto-containing products concurrently. Aceto should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Aceto in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceto. Use caution when administering Aceto in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceto IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceto IV in patients with Aceto allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Aceto IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceto IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Aceto is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceto may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceto may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceto. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceto may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Aceto overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceto overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceto concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceto. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Acical is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Acical containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Elemental Acical tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
      "mode_of_action": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2.

In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.1000 mg tablet: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",

Deficiency of the micronutrients is noticed in patients with osteoporosis.",
      "dosage": "Adult: 1 film-coated tablet twice daily, preferably 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening or as directed by physician. It is best taken with or just after main meals with a full glass of water.Children 3-7 years: 1 effervescent tablet daily.7 years to older: 1 to 2 effervescent tablet daily.",
      "interaction": "The risk of hypercalcemia should be considered in patients taking thiazide diuretics since these drugs can reduce urinary calcium excretion. Hypocalcaemia must be avoided in digitalized patients. Certain foods (e.g. those containing oxalic acid, phosphate or phytinic acid) may reduce the absorption of calcium. Concomitant treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates can decrease the effect of Vitamin-D 3 because of metabolic activation. Concomitant use of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of Vitamin D3. The effects of digitalis and other cardiac glycosides may be attenuated with the oral administration of calcium combined with Vitamin-D 3 . Strict medical supervision is needed and, if necessary monitoring of ECG and calcium. Calcium salts may reduce the absorption of thyroxin, bisphosphonates, sodium fluoride, quinolone or tetracycline antibiotics or iron. It is advisable to allow a minimum period of four hours before taking the calcium.",
      "contraindications": "Absolute contraindications are hypercalcaemia resulting from myeloma, bone metastasis or other malignant bone disease, sarcoidosis; primary hyperparathyroidism and Vitamin-D 3 overdosage, Severe renal failure.

      "side_effects": "The use of calcium supplements has rarely given rise to mild gastro-intestinal disturbances such as constipation, flatulence, nausea, gastric pain, diarrhea. Following administration of vitamin-D3 supplements occasional skin rash has been reported. Hypercalciuria and in rare cases hypercalcaemia have been seen with long term treatment at high doses.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "During pregnancy and lactation treatment should always be under the direction of a physician. During pregnancy and lactation, requirements for calcium and vitamin-D 3 are increased but in deciding on the required supplementation allowances should be made for availability of these agents from other sources. If calcium and iron supplements are both required to be administered to the patient, they should be taken at different times. Overdoses of vitamin-D 3 have shown teratogenic effects in pregnant animals. In humans long term hypercalcaemia can lead to physical and mental retardation, aortic stenosis and retinopathy in a new born child. Vitamin-D 3 and its metabolites pass into the breast milk.",
      "precautions": "Patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria should be supervised carefully. Periodic checks of plasma calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion should be made in patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria. Urinary calcium excretion should also be measured. In patients with a history of renal stones urinary calcium excretion should be measured to exclude hypercalciuria. With long term treatment it is advisable to monitor serum and urinary calcium levels and kidney function, and reduce and stop treatment temporarily if urinary calcium exceeds 7.5 mmol/24 hours.

      "mode_of_action": "Dexamethasone is a cortisone derivative whose high activity due to the presence of methyl group in the 16-alpha position and of a fluorine atom in the 9-alpha position. The result is that its anti-inflammatory activity is 30 times greater and its overall therapeutic effectiveness 8-10 times greater than that of hydrocortisone. Like other glucocorticoids, it is anti-allergic, anti-exudative and anti-proliferative. Therapeutic concentrations of Dexamethasone are found in both the cornea and aqueous humor 15-30 minutes after local application of single drop of 0.1% solution.

      "mode_of_action": "Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.",
      "dosage": "Hypercalcemia of malignancy: The maximum recommended dose of Zoledronic Acid in hypercalcemia of malignancy (serum calcium 12 mg/dl or 3.0 mmol/l) is 4 mg. The 4 mg dose must be given as a single-dose intravenous infusion. Dose adjustment of Zoledronic Acid is not necessary in treating patients for hypercalcemia of malignancy presenting with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Re-treatment with Zoledronic Acid may be considered if serum calcium does not return to normal after initial treatment. It is recommended that a minimum of 7 days elapse before re-treatment, to allow for full response to the initial dose. Multiple myeloma and bone metastases of solid tumors: The recommended dose of Zoledronic Acid in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic bone lesions from solid tumors is 4 mg infused every 3-4 weeks. Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU of Vitamin-D daily.",
      "interaction": "In clinical studies, Acidron has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without interactions. Caution is advised when Acidron are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Acidron is used in combination with thalidomide. Concomitant use of loop diuretics with Acidron increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Caution is indicated when Acidron is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.",
      "contraindications": "The drug is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates; severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min); pregnancy and lactation.",
      "side_effects": "The post-dose side-effects are headache, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, osteonecrosis of jaw, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, flu-like syndrome, hypocalcemia, myalgia, arthralgia and hypophosphataemia.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Zoledronic acid is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women. It is also not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.",
      "precautions": "Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Acidron. This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. Adequate hydration can be achieved by the patient drinking two glasses of fluid (such as water) before and after the infusion. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium and potassium, as well as serum creatinine should be carefully monitored after initiating Acidron therapy. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia or hypomagnesemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. Moreover, careful renal function monitoring should be considered.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Patients with renal impairment: The use of Acidron is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance >60 ml/min. Based on creatinine clearance the following dose should be used in patient with impaired renal function: CrCl > 60 ml/min: 4 mg (5 ml) CrCl 50-60 ml/min: 3.5 mg (4.4 ml) CrCl 40-49 ml/min: 3.3 mg (4.1 ml) CrCl 30-39 ml/min: 3 mg (3.8 ml)",
      "overdose_effects": "Clinical experience with acute over dosage is limited. Over dosage may cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. In such case, reduction in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium should be corrected by intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate and magnesium sulfate respectively.",
      "drug_classes": "Bisphosphonate preparations",

      "mode_of_action": "Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.",
      "dosage": "Active Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.",
      "interaction": "Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acifix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.",
      "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",
      "side_effects": "In general, Acifix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acifix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "precautions": "Symptomatic response to therapy with Acifix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acifix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance. Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded. Patients should be cautioned that Acifix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole. There have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. No evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients. Co-administration of atazanavir with Acifix is not recommended. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile. Hypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Acifix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acifix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",

Aciflox is also indicated for- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Acute Maxillary Sinusitis (AMS) Urinary tract infections including gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, chancroid and other sexually transmitted diseases. Bacterial prostatitis. Bacterial diarrhoea Osteomyelitis Other uses include treatment of tuberculosis in combination with rifampicin and isoniazid, treatment of leprosy in combination with standard drugs.",
      "mode_of_action": "Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and kills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs and has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous), Mycobacteria and Chlamydia spp.Absorption: Quinoflox‚ is well absorbed following oral administration with an absolute oral bioavailability of 92%. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin concentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (±0.2) µg/mL. The area under the curve following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 34 (±6.8) µg·hr/mL. Steady-state plasma concentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was double the daily dose. Maximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between 3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours. Oral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, including high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin by as much as 50%.Distribution: Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox‚ distributes well into the body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss ) of 3.9 (±0.8) L/kg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in serum at about 45%. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma. Mean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and 20 hours postdose, respectively.Metabolism: Quinoflox‚ is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II glucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize or interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450.Excretion: The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox‚ were 11.4 (±3.5) and 1.5 (±0.5) L/hr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces (50%) and urine (50%). Approximately 10% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function.",
      "dosage": "The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with normal renal function is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets). The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).",

It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

      "mode_of_action": "Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.",
      "dosage": "Active Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.",
      "interaction": "Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acipra with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.",
      "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",
      "side_effects": "In general, Acipra is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acipra may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "precautions": "Symptomatic response to therapy with Acipra does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acipra 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance. Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded. Patients should be cautioned that Acipra gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole. There have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. No evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients. Co-administration of atazanavir with Acipra is not recommended. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile. Hypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Acipra, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acipra. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",

It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
      "dosage": "For oral inhalation only. Should be taken by inhaler device. 400 mcg/12 meg, twice daily (One inhalation capsule in the morning and one in the evening ). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.",
      "interaction": "Use of other adrenergic by any route may potentiate the effect of Aclitol. Use with caution. Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution. Diuretics: Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non-potassium sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta2-agonists. Use with caution. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of formoterol fumarate on cardiovascular system. Beta-blockers: Use with caution and only when medically necessary. Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administrations of Aclitol with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.",
      "contraindications": "Use of a long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), including formoterol fumarate, one of the active ingredients in this combination, without an inhaled corticosteroid is contraindicated in patients with asthma. Hypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or formoterol fumarate or to any component of this product.",

There are no available data on the effects of aclidinium bromide, or formoterol fumarate on the breastfed child or on milk production or presence in human milk.",
      "precautions": "Asthma-related death: Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of serious asthma-related events. Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms. Do not use in combination with additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Aclitol and institute alternative therapy. Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur. Worsening urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if symptoms occur.",

      "mode_of_action": "Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.",
      "dosage": "Cream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response. Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers.

Dermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.",
      "side_effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism. Prolonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved. In rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Aclobet is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",
      "pediatric_uses": "In infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.",

      "indications": "Aclobet-N is indicated in- Short courses treatment of recalcitrant eczemas. Neurodermatoses. Psoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis) where secondary bacterial infection or fungal infection is present, suspected or likely to occur. Other inflammatory conditions which do not respond satisfactorily to less active steroids.",
      "mode_of_action": "Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",
      "dosage": "Adults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).",
      "interaction": "Neomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.",
      "contraindications": "This medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.",
      "side_effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.",
      "precautions": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.",
      "overdose_effects": "Acute overdosage is very unlikely to occur. No overdose-related problem yet reported. However, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation, topical steroids should be discontinued gradually.",

Water depletion (dehydration) tends to occur when these losses are not matched by a comparable intake, as for example may occur in coma or dysphagia or in the aged person who may not drink water in sufficient amount on their own initiative. It provides a readily metabolizable nutrient. One litre of 5% solution provides about 170 calories. Glucose solutions are also given in regimens with calcium bicarbonate, and insulin for the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. They are also given, after correction of hyperglycaemia, during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, when they must be accompanied by continuing insulin infusion.

      "dosage": "5% dextrose solution: The dose of Dextrose infusion is variable. It is dependent on individual patient requirements. For 5% dextrose solution, the dose frequently ranges from 500 to 1000 ml. The maximum rate of infusion that will not cause glycosuria is 0.5 g/kg/hour. About 95% is retained when the rate is 0.8 g/kg/hr. the maximum rate of glucose utilization is about 800 mg per kg body weight per hour.10% dextrose solution: Dose is variable.

      "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
      "mode_of_action": "Mechanism of Action: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
      "dosage": "Erectile dysfunction: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
      "interaction": "Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Acmegra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Acmegra and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Acmegra, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia.Urogenital: prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria.Special Senses: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",

      "precautions": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",
      "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Acmegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.",

When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Acmegra produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Acmegra has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation."

      "indications": "Acnev cream is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.",
      "mode_of_action": "Clascoterone (cortexolone 17 α-propionate) is a novel antagonist of androgen receptors. It binds to androgen receptors with high affinity. By competing with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, Clascoterone works by blocking the androgen receptor signaling cascades that promotes acne pathogenesis such as sebaceous gland proliferation, excess sebum production and inflammatory pathways.Acne is a multifactorial skin condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, and inflammation. Circulating and locally synthesized natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), serve as causative factors in both males and females. Upon binding of DHT, the DHT-androgen receptor complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in acne pathogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, excess sebum production, and inflammatory cytokine production. Clascoterone is a potent antagonist at ARs and competes for androgens in binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signalling of ARs that promote acne.Androgenetic alopecia is also an androgen-dependent and highly genetic condition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia. By blocking the interaction between DHT and aARs, clascoterone inhibits AR-regulated transcription and DHT-induced IL-6 synthesis.",
      "dosage": "Clean the affected area gently then apply a thin uniform layer (approximately 1 gm) of Clascoterone cream twice per day in the morning and evening to the affected area. Avoid accidental transfer of Clascoterone cream into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, this should be rinsed thoroughly with water or as directed by physician.Use in Children and Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Clascoterone cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have not been established in pediatric patients under 12 years of age",
      "interaction": "No clinical study evaluating the drug interaction of Acnev cream has been conducted.",
      "contraindications": "Data of contraindication of clascoterone cream in not available.",
      "side_effects": "Most common adverse reactions occurring in 7% to 12% of patients are erythema/ reddening, pruritus, and scaling/dryness. Additionally, >3% of patients may suffer from edema, stinging and burning.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, 1421 subjects 12 years and older with facial acne vulgaris applied Acnev cream or vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks. Overall, 62% of the subjects were female, and 38% were male, 91% of the patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 19.7 years.Local skin reactions (edema, erythema/redness, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, stinging/burning, striae rubrea, telangiectasia) were observed during the 12-week treatment and occurred in a similar percentage of subjects treated with vehicle.",

      "indications": "Acora, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.",
      "mode_of_action": "Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. The P2Y12 receptor couples with Gαi2 and other Gi proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Gi mediated signalling also activates PI3K, Akt, Rap1b, and potassium channels. The downstream effects of these activities mediate hemostasis and lead to platelet aggregation. Antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor reduces development of occlusive thromboses, which can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",
      "dosage": "Patients taking Ticagrelor should also take a daily low maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75-150 mg unless specifically contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes: Ticagrelor treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Ticagrelor twice daily is recommended for 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. History of myocardial infarction: Ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for patients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial one-year treatment with ticagrelor or another adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor therapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be initiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor inhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of extended treatment. Switch therapy: If a switch is needed, the first dose of ticagrelor should be administered 24 hours following the last dose of the other antiplatelet medication. Missed dose: A patient who misses a dose of ticagrelor should take only one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. Elderly: No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. No information is available concerning the treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore ticagrelor is not recommended in these patients. Hepatic impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is therefore contraindicated. Only limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor should be used with caution. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Pediatric population: The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in hildren below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. Contra-indications, warnings etc.",
      "interaction": "Effects of medicinal and other products on Acora; CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) inhibitors with Acora is contraindicated. CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of Acora with potent CYP3A inducers (rifampicin)may decrease exposure and efficacy of Acora, therefore, their concomitant use with Acora is discouraged. Cyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor): No data are available on concomitant use of Acora with other active substances that also are potent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may increase Acora exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be made with caution. Effects of Acora on other medicinal products: Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4: The concomitant use of Acora with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended. Atorvastatin: Co-administration of atorvastatin and Acora increased atorvastatin acid Cmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all atorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant. Acora is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of Acora and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as Acora may increase the exposure to this medicinal products. P-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine): Appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent medicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with Acora. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9: Co-administration of Acora with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of either medicinal product, which suggests that Acora is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to alter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide. Oral contraceptives: No clinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is co-administered with Acora. Medicinal products known to induce bradycardia: No evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions were observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, and 4% digoxin). Other concomitant therapy: No evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, proton pump inhibitors, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) was observed. Due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with the concomitant administration of Acora with medicinal products (heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin) known to alter haemostasis. Due to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with Acora as this may increase the risk of bleeding.",

Uncommon: Tumour bleedings, Hypersensitivity including angioedema, Confusion, Intracranial haemorrhage, Eye haemorrhage, Ear haemorrhage, Retroperitoneal haemorrhage, Muscular bleedings.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Ticagrelor is not recommended during pregnancy. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and its active metabolites in milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.",
      "precautions": "Bleeding risk: The use of Acora in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, Acora should be used with caution in the following patient groups; Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation disorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). Antifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa therapy may increase haemostasis. Acora may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and controlled.Surgery: Patients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking Acora before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and the antiplatelet effect is not desired, Acora should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery.Patients with prior ischaemic stroke: ACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with Acora for up to 12 months. Patients at risk for bradycardic events: Due to the limited clinical experience, Acora should be used with caution in these patients.Dyspnoea: Patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing dyspnoea with Acora. Acora should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma and/or COPD. Creatinine elevations: Creatinine levels may increase during treatment with Acora. In patients with ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the treatment with Acora, paying special attention to patients ≥75 years, patients with moderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Uric acid increase: Hyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with Acora. Caution is advised in patients with a history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. Other: Based on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and relative efficacy of Acora compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of Acora and high maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (>300 mg) is not recommended.Premature discontinuation: Premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Acora, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or MI due to the patient’s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.",
      "overdose_effects": "Acora is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions which may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses.",

      "indications": "Acos is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Acos is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
      "mode_of_action": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity. Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
      "dosage": "Oral-Adult: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.Children: 10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months 200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg 300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg. In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given. Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only): The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin. Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.",
      "interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Acos and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. Terfenadine: Acos did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
      "contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
      "side_effects": "Acos is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
      "precautions": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in renal impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.Use in hepatic impairment: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.",
      "overdose_effects": "There is no data on overdosage with Acos. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.",

Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed.

      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Act. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Act overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Act levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of Act are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of Act to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Act-containing products concurrently. Act should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of Act in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Act. Use caution when administering Act in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Act IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Act IV in patients with Act allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Act IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Act IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Act is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Act. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Act may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

      "indications": "Actical tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. It may be used to treat conditions caused by low calcium levels such as bone loss (osteoporosis), weak bones (osteomalacia, rickets), decreased activity of the parathyroid gland (hypoparathyroidism) and a certain muscle disease (latent tetany). It may also be used in certain patients to make sure they are getting enough calcium (e.g. postmenopausal).",
      "mode_of_action": "Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscle, and bone. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones. Having the right amount of calcium is important for building and keeping strong bones. Calcium citrate is well absorbed on an empty stomach and does not constipate. Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption.Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D 3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. It is normally formed in the kidneys from its immediate precursor, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In physiological amounts it augments the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and plays a significant part in the regulation of bone mineralization. The defective production of calcitriol in chronic renal failure contributes to the abnormalities of mineral metabolism found in that disorder. The biological effects of calcitriol are mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in most cell types and functioning as a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds to DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes. Oral administration of Calcitriol to patients with chronic renal failure compensates for impaired endogenous production of calcitriol which is decreased when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min. Consequently, intestinal malabsorption of calcium and phosphate and the resulting hypocalcemia are improved, thereby reversing the signs and symptoms of bone disease. In patients with established post-menopausal osteoporosis, Calcitriol increases calcium absorption, elevates circulating levels of calcitriol and reduces vertebral fracture frequency.",
      "dosage": "1-4 tablets daily with or without food depending on clinical situation or as directed by the registered physician.",
      "interaction": "Reduced absorption of tetracyclines, quinolones and oral biphosphates with concurrent calcium use. Calcium absorption may be reduced by corticosteroids. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and metabolic alkalosis with thiazide diuretics. High blood calcium level may increase the efect of cardiac glycosides. Reduced erlotinib efcacy with calcium. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia with paricalcitol. Enzyme inducing antiepileptics increases the metabolism of vitamin D. Fatal encephalopathy can occur in patients with renal failure when given calcium citrate and aluminium products concurrently due to marked rise in aluminium levels.",

      "mode_of_action": "Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of Ketoprofen and is responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Ketoprofen. The inactive R(-)-enantiomer does not contribute to the therapeutic properties of Ketoprofen but adds to the metabolic load. Dexketoprofen has been formulated as a trometamol salt. Its high solubility in water means a rapid absorption through the gut wall which results in a more rapid onset of action than Ketoprofen. Peak plasma concentrations are attained more quickly than other widely used analgesics with an onset of action of 30 minutes. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of Dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively. From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(-)-Ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of Dexketoprofen [S(+)-Ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans. The anti-inflammatory potency of Dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of Ketoprofen.",
      "dosage": "The dose of Dexketoprofen 25 mg tablets depends on the type, severity, and duration of pain. The recommended dose is generally 1 tablet every 8 hours, with no more than 3 tablets daily. The elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment should start treatment with a total daily dose of no more than 2 tablets. Normally it is recommended to take the tablets with food.

Calcium folinate rescue- a treatment technique using calcium folinate in conjunction with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to minimise systemic toxicity. The treatment of megaloblastic anaemias due to sprue, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy, infancy, liver disease and malabsorption syndrome.",
      "mode_of_action": "This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",
      "dosage": "Folinic Acid rescue: Folinic Acid rescue should begin as soon as possible after an inadvertent overdosage and within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is delayed excretion. There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses.The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended.Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists: If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration.Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency): 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day.Use in children and adolescents: The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not beenestablished.",
      "interaction": "Folinates given in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbitone, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution is required during concurrent administration of calcium folinate with fluoropyrimidine as this has been associated with seizures and syncope.",
      "contraindications": "Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.",
      "side_effects": "The most common side effects of Actifol are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.",
      "precautions": "Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include: Alkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites). Maintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m2/24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy. Plasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10-7 molar.",
      "overdose_effects": "There have been no reported sequelae in patients who have received significantly more calcium folinate than the recommended dosage. Flowever, excessive amounts of calcium folinate may nullity the chemotherapeutic effect of folic acid antagonists. There is no specific antidote to calcium folinate overdose.

Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.",
      "dosage": "In constipation ( chronic constipation): Adults: Initially 3-6 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1½-6 tea-spoons daily Children up to 14 years: Initially 3 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1-2 tea-spoons daily Infants and toddlers: Initially 1-2 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1 tea-spoon daily In damaged intestinal flora: Adults: 1-2 tea-spoons daily Children: 1 tea-spoon daily For reduction of blood ammonia level: Hyper-ammoniemia in hepatopathy: a maximum of 18-30 tea-spoons daily. In portal systemic encephalopathy: hourly doses of 6-9 tea-spoons of Lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose may then be reduced.",
      "interaction": "There is no significant drug interactions with Actilac. The glycosidic effect of cardiac glycosides can be intensified by potassium deficiency in abuse.",
      "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to either galactose and or lactose; galactose-free diet, gastro-cardial symptom complex, suspected intestinal obstruction.",
      "side_effects": "Occasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium).",
      "pregnancy_cat": "US FDA Pregnancy Category of Lactulose is B. Studies show that Lactulose has no adverse effects. Decisions regarding use during pregnancy and lactation must be made by registered physician.",
      "precautions": "Actilac should be administered with care to patients who are intolerant to Actilac. The dose used in the treatment of (pre) coma hepaticum is usually much higher and may need to be taken into consideration for diabetics.",
      "overdose_effects": "There have been no reports of accidental overdosage. In the event of acute overdosage it is expected that diarrhoea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms.",
      "drug_classes": "Osmotic purgatives",
      "storage_conditions": "Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",
      "compound_summary": "Molecular Formula : C12H22O11Chemical Structure :",
      "description": "Actilac is a hyperosmolar laxative which is used as an effective treatment approach for constipation. It is a non-absorbable disaccharide which draws water into the bowel; causes distention through fluid accumulation, thus promotes soft stool and accelerates bowel motion."
