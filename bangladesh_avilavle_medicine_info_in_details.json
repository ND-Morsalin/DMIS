It is indicated for the treatment of following diseases: Polyneuropathy of any origin such alcoholic or toxiconeuropathies as-diabetic, Neuritis, Neuralgia, Cervical Syndrome, Shoulder-arm syndrome, Lumbago, Sciatica, Myalgia, Intercostal neuralgia, Herpes Zoster, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Supportive treatment in facial paresis.",
      "mode_of_action": "Vitamin B1 converts carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids into energy, promotes healthy nerves, improves mood, strengthens the heart. Vitamin B6 forms RBCs, helps cells to make proteins, manufactures neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin and releases stored forms of energy, helps to prevent CVS diseases and stroke, helps to lift depression and eases insomnia. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases.The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.",

      "indications": "3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-C is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-C did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",
      "storage_conditions": "Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

      "indications": "3-Geocef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-Geocef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3-Geocef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-Geocef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-Geocef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",
      "storage_conditions": "Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

      "indications": "Vitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. 3D is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth, preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. 3D is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. 3D has vital role on immunity boost up.",
      "mode_of_action": "The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.",
      "dosage": "For capsule: Adults: Treatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day. To confirm the target level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, measurement of it should be determined 3-4 months after initiating the maintenance therapy. Prevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 4 weeks. Higher doses may be required in certain situations. Addition to specific therapy for osteoporosis: 20000 IU once a month. For capsule: Children (12-18 years): Treatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. Prevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 6 weeks. For film-coated tablet: 1000 IU (1-2 tablets) daily, or as directed by physician. Take the medicine with food or within 1 hour after a meal.For oroflash or chewable tablets: 1000 IU to 2000 IU daily, or as directed by physician.

Direction of use of Injection-For oral use- Step-1: Place the thumb on ampoule and break the upper narrow part of the ampoule. Step-2: Pour out the solution of the ampoule in a spoon. Step-3: Mix the solution with water or milk before oral use. For lM use- Step-1: Place the thumb on ampoule and break the upper narrow part of the ampoule. Step-2: Then use as IM injection.",
      "interaction": "Drug interaction with medication: Concomitant treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates can decrease the effect of vitamin D because of metabolic activation. Concomitant use of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of vitamin D. The effectsof digitalis and other cardiac glycosides may be accentuated with the oral administration of calcium combined with vitamin D. Strict medical supervision is needed and, if necessary monitoring of ECG and calcium. Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resins such as cholestyramine or laxatives such as paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D. The cytotoxic agent actinomycin and imidazole antifungal agents interfere with vitamin D activity by inhibiting the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidney enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase.",
      "contraindications": "Vitamin D3 is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D3 (or medicines of the same class) and any of the excipients. It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.",
      "side_effects": "Generally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few most common side effects can generally occur including hypocalcaemia syndrome or calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypocalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of colecalciferol.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Studies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required. During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatmentVitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.",
      "precautions": "Plasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.",
      "overdose_effects": "The most serious consequence of acute or chronic overdose is hypercalcaemia due to vitamin D toxicity. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, polyuria, anorexia, weakness, apathy, thirst and constipation. Chronic overdoses can lead to vascular and organ calcification as a result of hypercalcaemia. Treatment should consist of stopping all intakes of vitamin D and rehydration.",

      "mode_of_action": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
      "dosage": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
      "interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
      "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
      "side_effects": "3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
      "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3RD Cef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3RD Cef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.",
      "storage_conditions": "Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

      "mode_of_action": "Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
      "dosage": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.For palliative management of cancer: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.Maintenance therapy: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules: Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Usual adult dose for cervical cancer: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.Intra-arterial infusion: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.Combination with radiation: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.Combination with other anticancer drugs: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",
      "interaction": "Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5 FU PhaRes following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
      "side_effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-5 FU PhaRes therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5 FU PhaRes.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5 FU PhaRes. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
      "precautions": "5-5 FU PhaRes is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Neonates: No dosage recommendations are made for neonates.Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.The elderly: No special precautions are required, doses being adjusted for the patient's weight and height.",
      "overdose_effects": "Cases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of the hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-5 FU PhaRes toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.",

Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5-Fluril. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
      "precautions": "5-5-Fluril is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.",

      "overdose_effects": "Cases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of the hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-5-Fluril toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.",

It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of 5X within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.Fertility Following Use: A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with 5X for emergency contraception. So, to prevent pregnancy on a later episode of sexual intercourse one should use the barrier method (ex. Condom).Effect on Menstrual Cycle: After 5X intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. 7% of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, a pregnancy test should be performed. 9% of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after the use of 5X.",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. A-Cal is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. A-Cal containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Elemental A-Cal tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
      "mode_of_action": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.",

As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.1000 mg tablet: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "A-Cal may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. A-Cal may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when A-Cal is used as the primary phosphate binder.",
      "contraindications": "Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Concomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level) When hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.",
      "side_effects": "Orally administered A-Cal may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in children: A-Cal has been extensively studied in children and infants with chronic renal failure and is both safe and effective.Use in elderly: In case of elderly patients with renal failure when A-Cal is taken constipation may be troublesome one for this group.

      "mode_of_action": "Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.",
      "dosage": "Tablet: The usual oral dose is 1 tablet (20 mg) 2 times daily, first dose in the morning and another 7 hours apart. Although maintenance doses ranging from 20 mg to 120 mg (1-6 tablets), a dose of 10 mg (1/2 tablet) is suitable when lower dosage is used at the starting of treatment or as directed by a registered physician.Sustained Release Capsule: The usual oral dose is 1 capsule (50 mg) daily or as directed by the registered physician.",
      "interaction": "Concomitant use of A-Card with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated. Concomitant use of A-Card with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated. The vasodilating effects of A-Card may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary.",
      "contraindications": "Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.",
      "side_effects": "Headache, feelings of dizziness, hypotension may occur sometimes.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 540 and 810 mg/kg/day, respectively, have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to isosorbide mononitrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Isosorbide Mononitrate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of A-Card. A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known.Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later.As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card’s antianginal efficacy.Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",
      "overdose_effects": "Symptoms: Most common symptoms are hypotension, throbbing headache, tachycardia, and flushing. Methemoglobinemia may occur with massive doses.Treatment: Treatment consists of placing patients in recumbent position and administering fluids; alpha-adrenergic vasopressors may be required. Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methyline blue at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV slowly.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
      "mode_of_action": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
      "dosage": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
      "contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
      "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
      "precautions": "There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",

      "mode_of_action": "This preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.",

Other painful conditions resulting from trauma including, fracture, low back pain, sprains, strains, dislocations, control of pain and inflammation in orthopaedic, dental and other minor surgeries, postoperative pain, pain of renal colic etc. The injection also contains Lidocaine which acts as a local anaesthetic. Therefore the possibility of pain at the injection site, which is most likely to occur after intramuscular injection, is minimized if the Lidocaine containing injection is used in the above indications.",
      "mode_of_action": "Diclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic and antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric effects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",
      "dosage": "Adult: One ampoule once (or in severe cases, twice) daily by intramuscular injection.Renal colic: One ampoule once daily intramuscularly. A second dose may be administered after 30 minutes if necessary.Children: In Juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac Sodium per kg body weight daily in divided doses.Elderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status, or as prescribed by the physician.",
      "interaction": "Lithium and Digoxin: Diclofenac may increase plasma concentrations of Lithium and Digoxin. Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that Diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect. Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Diclofenac concomitantly. Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other. Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAIDs and quinolones. Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of Diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With Aspirin, the plasma levels of each are lowered, although no clinical significance is known. Diuretics: Various NSAIDs are liable to inhibit the activity of diuretics. Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. So, serum potassium should be monitored.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by Aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibiting activity Diclofenac is also contraindicated. Because of the presence of Lidocaine, this injection is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. In patients with Adams-Stokes syndrome or with severe degrees of SA, AV, or intraventricular heart block in the absence of an artificial pacemaker, and for those patients who are hypersensitive to any of the excipients used in the formulation (Sodium Metabisulphite, Disodium Edetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol), this injection is also contraindicated.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine injection are usually mild and transient. However if serious side effects occur the injection should be discontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very rare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In isolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may occur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadedness etc.",

      "precautions": "Renal: Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly should be kept under close observation, since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The lowest effective dose should be used and renal function should be monitored. Hepatic: If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur (eosinophilia, rash), Diclofenac should be discontinued. All patients who are receiving long term treatment with NSAIDs should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).",

Diclofenac Dispersible Tablet: Adults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals. Children: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months. Diclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.Diclofenac Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.Diclofenac injection: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.Diclofenac Gel: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.",
      "interaction": "A-Fenac SR may have the following drug interactions:Lithium and digoxin: A-Fenac SR may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.",

Read moreA-Flox is indicated for the treatment of infections due to Gram-positive organisms, including infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci. These indications include: Skin and soft tissue infections: Boils, abscess, carbuncles, infected skin conditions (e.g. ulcer, eczema, acne, furunculosis, cellulitis, infected wounds, infected burns, otitis media and externa, impetigo). Respiratory tract infections: Pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, quinsy. It is also used for the treatment of other infections i.e. osteomyelitis, enteritis, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, meningitis, septicaemia caused by A-Flox-sensitive organisms. As a prophylactic agent, it is used during major surgical procedures where appropriate; for example, cardiothoracic and orthopedic surgery.",
      "mode_of_action": "Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",
      "dosage": "Oral administration: Adult: 250 mg four times daily. Dosage may be doubled in severe infections. In osteomyelitis and endocarditis, up to 8 gm daily is used in 6-8 hourly divided doses. Children (2-10 years): 1/2 of adult dose. Children (Under 2 years): 1/4 of adult dose. Parenteral administration:Adult or Elderly: Intramuscular Injection: 250 mg four times daily. Intravenous Injection: 250 mg-1 g four times daily by slow injection over 3 to 4 minutes or by intravenous infusion. All systemic doses may be doubled in severe infections: doses up to 8 g daily have been suggested for endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Children: 2-10 years: half of the adult dose.

      "mode_of_action": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
      "dosage": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment.

Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
      "precautions": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.",
      "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.",

Treatment of mothers who intend to breast feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn",
      "precautions": "Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with A-Mectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: back pain, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, or coma.",

For eradication of fungal colonization in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. For the treatment of super infections due to gram-positive bacteria. A-Migel cream is indicated in dermatomycoses, e.g.: Tinea pedis (Athlete's foot) Tinea corporis (Tinea circinata) Tinea manuum Tinea cruris due to: Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum audouinii, Epidermophyton floccosum Candidial infections Tinea versicolor. Infections of the skin (e.g. intertrigo) Perianal infections Stomatitis angularis (cheilitis) Balanoposthitis Otitis externa In addition miconazole cream has a very rapid alleviating effect on the pruritis which frequently accompanies infection.",
      "mode_of_action": "Pharmacodynamics: Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die.Pharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.",
      "dosage": "Miconazole Oral Gel-Oropharyngeal candidosis- Infants 4-24 months: 1.25 ml (1⁄4 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times day after meals. Adult and children 2 years of age and older: 2.5 ml (1⁄2 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times a day after meals. Gastrointestinal tract candidosis- Infants (4 months of age or above): Children and adults who have difficulty swallowing tablets: 20 mg per kg body weight per day, in four divided doses. The daily dose should not exceed 250 mg (10 ml gel) four times daily. Missed Dose: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. In case of next dosing time, omit the misseddose and continue your usual course.Miconazole Cream: Sufficient Miconazole Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and cutaneous candidiasis and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If Miconazole Cream is used in intertriginous areas it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun.All lesions usually disappear after 2 to 5 weeks.Prolong treatment for 10 days to prevent relapse. However, Candida infections, tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.",
      "interaction": "Concomitant treatment with Terfenadine, Astemizole and Cisapride should be avoided because in vitro studies suggest that A-Migel may inhibit their metabolism, so these products miqht precipitated. A-Migel may delay Phenytoin and Cyclosporine metabolism and this might precipitate Phenytoin and Cyclosporine toxicity, respectively.",
      "contraindications": "Miconazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.",
      "side_effects": "Occasionally nausea and vomiting, diarrhea with long term use and rarely allergic reactions.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "There is no information regarding the safety of Miconazole oral gel during pregnancy. So Miconazole oral gel should be avoided in pregnant women if possible or the potential hazards should be balanced against the possible benefits. As many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Miconazole is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "precautions": "If the concomitant use of A-Migel and anticoagulant is considered, the anti-coagulant effect should be monitored and titrated. A-Migel and phenytoin plasma level should also be monitored when used concomitantly. In infants and young children, caution must be taken to ensure that the gel does not obstruct the throat.",

      "indications": "A-One is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",
      "dosage": "Tablet: Adult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily. Children (6-12 years): ½ to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of A-One. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of A-One overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic A-One levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of A-One are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of A-One to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other A-One-containing products concurrently. A-One should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of A-One in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of A-One. Use caution when administering A-One in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue A-One IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use A-One IV in patients with A-One allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of A-One IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of A-One IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: A-One is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of A-One may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of A-One may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of A-One. Ingestion of 5 g or more of A-One may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of A-One overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

      "indications": "A-One XR is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
      "mode_of_action": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

      "interaction": "Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of A-One XR. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of A-One XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic A-One XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.",
      "contraindications": "It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects of A-One XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
      "precautions": "Care is advised in the administration of A-One XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other A-One XR-containing products concurrently. A-One XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.Administration of A-One XR in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of A-One XR. Use caution when administering A-One XR in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue A-One XR IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use A-One XR IV in patients with A-One XR allergy.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of A-One XR IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of A-One XR IV in adults.Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: A-One XR is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of A-One XR may be warranted.Patients with Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of A-One XR may be warranted.",
      "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of A-One XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of A-One XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms: Symptoms of A-One XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

To reduce total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with or exacerbated by diabetes mellitus or renal transplantation.",
      "mode_of_action": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
      "dosage": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia- Adults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily. Child (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily. Familial hypercholesterolaemia- Adults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia). Child (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily. Prevention of cardiovascular events- Adults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response. Another guideline: The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",
      "interaction": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.Warfarin: A-Statin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.",
      "contraindications": "Atorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",
      "side_effects": "A-Statin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to A-Statin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.",

Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnantLactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.",
      "precautions": "Liver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. A-Statin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. A-Statin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of A-Statin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.Gender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with A-Statin between men and women.Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of A-Statin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of A-Statin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of A-Statin are markedly increased.",
      "overdose_effects": "Specific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.",

      "mode_of_action": "Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic which is bacteriostatic for manybacteria, rickettsiae, chlamydia, mycoplasma and brucella. It exerts its antimicrobial effect by inhibiting protein synthesis. After a single oral dose of Tetracycline peak plasma concentration is attained in 2 to 4 hours. The drug's half-life is in the range of 6 to 9 hours. Because of its enterohepatic circulation, Tetracycline may be present in the blood for a long time after cessation of therapy.",
      "dosage": "Usual adult dosage: 250 or 500 mg every 6 hours by mouth preferably 1 hour before or 2 hours after meal. Higher doses up to 3 or 4 gm daily have occasionally been given in resistant infections. Specific Dosage Recommendation: Brucellosis: 500 mg 6 hourly for 3 weeks. Chlamydial infections: 500 mg 6 hourly for at least 2 weeks. Non-specific urethritis: 500 mg 6 hourly for 7 days. Severe acne: 1 gm/day for 2-3 weeks followed by 1 capsule daily for 3-4 months. Gonorrhoea: Initial oral dose of 1.5 gm followed by 500 mg 6 hourly for 4 days, the total dose should be 9 gm. Syphilis: 500 mg 6 hourly for 15 days but therapy should be continued for 30 days if the disease has been present for longer than 1 year. Endocervical infections: 500 mg 6 hourly for 7 days. Children over 12 years of age: 25-50 mg/kg divided in 2 or 4 equal doses. The maximum dose should not exceed the recommended adult dose. Children below 12 years of age: Not recommended.Administration: Tetracycline should be taken orally, an hour before or two hours after meal and therapy should be continued for up to three days after characteristic symptoms of the infection have subsided. It should be used with caution in the treatment of elderly patients where accumulation is a possibility.",
      "interaction": "A-Tetra in combination with methoxy-fluorane may result nephrotoxicity. Antacids containing calcium, aluminium or magnesium impair the absorption of tetracycline and result in decreased serum level. A-Tetra inhibits the antimicrobial activity of penicillin when used concomitantly.",

Hypersensitivity reactions include purpura, pericarditis, angioneurotic oedema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus may occur. Haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia end eosinophilia have been reported.",
      "pregnancy_cat": "Tetracycline crosses the placenta, found in foetal tissues and has embryotoxic effect. Therefore, tetracycline should not be used in pregnancy unless considered essential in which case maximum daily dose should be 1 gm. Tetracycline has been found in human milk. Permanent tooth discoloration may occur in the developing infant and enamel hypoplasia has been reported.",
      "precautions": "Absorption of tetracycline is impaired by the concomitant administration of milk and by calcium, magnesium, iron and particularly aluminium salts commonly used as antacids. A-Tetra depresses plasma prothrombin activity. Therefore, reduced dosage of concurrent anticoagulants may be required. Lower doses are indicated in cases of renal impairment to avoid excessive systemic accumulation and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations are advisable. The concomitant use of oral tetracycline may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives and penicillins; an increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding may also be experienced.

      "mode_of_action": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
      "dosage": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of AB Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
      "contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",

Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",

Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- Mifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",

The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
      "pediatric_uses": "Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.",
      "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.",
