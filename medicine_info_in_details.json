A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known. Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card’s antianginal efficacy. Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",

Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor.

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",

Avoid co-administration of Abiron with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiron.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled. This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta Extend overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta Extend concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta Extend. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.",

Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

        "information": "Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",

By competing with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, Clascoterone works by blocking the androgen receptor signaling cascades that promotes acne pathogenesis such as sebaceous gland proliferation, excess sebum production and inflammatory pathways. Acne is a multifactorial skin condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, and inflammation. Circulating and locally synthesized natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), serve as causative factors in both males and females. Upon binding of DHT, the DHT-androgen receptor complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in acne pathogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, excess sebum production, and inflammatory cytokine production. Clascoterone is a potent antagonist at ARs and competes for androgens in binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signalling of ARs that promote acne. Androgenetic alopecia is also an androgen-dependent and highly genetic condition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia. By blocking the interaction between DHT and aARs, clascoterone inhibits AR-regulated transcription and DHT-induced IL-6 synthesis.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
