        "information": "Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-type Diuretic- Antihypertensive, used for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",
