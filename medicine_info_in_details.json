The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H + /k + -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.",

Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn’s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.",

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.",

        "information": ": Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.",

Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare.

Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.",
