As Regerd is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Regerd 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Regerd 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Regerd and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Regerd is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Regerd and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

As Regerd is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Regerd 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Regerd 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Regerd and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Regerd is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Regerd and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H 1 ) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

It is essential that qualified personnel and adequate facilities are available for the treatment of postoperative respiratory depression. Respiratory depression will abate approximately 10 minutes after the discontinuation of a Remifentanil infusion. Administration of the narcotic antagonist, naloxone, has not been shown to be more effective or more prompt in reversing respiratory depression than the discontinuation of Remifentanil. Naloxone can be used to manage severe respiratory depression or muscle rigidity. Bolus doses of Remifentanil should not be administered to patients who are spontaneously breathing and also receiving a continuous infusion of Remifentanil. Administration of Remifentanil at a rate greater than 0.2 mcg/kg/min is usually associated with hypoventilation (respiratory rate of less than 8 breaths/minute). The manufacturer strongly recommends that supplemental oxygen be supplied whenever Remifentanil is administered. Analgesic effects will dissipate within 5 to 10 minutes after discontinuation of Remifentanil. Adequate postoperative analgesia should be established prior to discontinuation of Remifentanil. The intravenous tubing supplying the Remifentanil infusion should be cleared of residual drug after the discontinuation of therapy.

Therefore, REMMO may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

Infliximab does not neutralize TNFα (lymphotoxin-α), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFα. Biological activities attributed to TNFα include: induction of pro inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, enhancement of leukocyte migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, induction of acute phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes. Cells expressing transmembrane TNFα bound by infliximab can be lysed in vitro or in vivo. Infliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNFα in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays utilizing human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and T lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanism(s) by which Infliximab exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Anti-TNFα antibodies reduce disease activity in the cotton-top tamarin colitis model, and decrease synovitis and joint erosions in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. Infliximab prevents disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human TNFα, and when administered after disease onset, allows eroded joints to heal.",

Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate.

Metformin may lower Vitamin B12 levels; so hematologic parameters shoud be monitored annually. Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause lactic acidosis. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and quick to appear, and usually occur when other health problems not related to the medicine are present and are very severe, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. Be sure to drink extra fluids when you exercise or increase your activity or if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Pancreatitis may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a fever, or lightheadedness.

It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about: Linagliptin and metformin combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take linagliptin and metformin combination with another type of diabetes medicine.

In cases of Renapine XR overdose, refractory hypotension should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (adrenaline and dopamine should be avoided, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of Renapine XR-induced alpha blockade).

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

        "information": "Roxadustat is an orally bioavailable, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), with potential anti-anemic activity. Upon administration, roxadustat binds to and inhibits HIF-PH, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of transcription factors in the HIF family under normal oxygen conditions. This prevents HIF breakdown and promotes HIF activity. Increased HIF activity leads to an increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, thereby enhancing erythropoiesis. It also reduces the expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin, improves iron availability, and boosts hemoglobin (Hb) levels. HIF regulates the expression of genes in response to reduced oxygen levels, including genes required for erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. Administration of roxadustat has been shown to induce coordinated erythropoiesis, increasing red blood cell count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within or near normal physiologic range, in multiple subpopulations of CKD patients, including in the presence of infammation, and without a need for supplemental intravenous iron. Roxadustat reversibly binds to and potently inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, reducing HIF-α breakdown and promoting HIF transcriptional activity. Activation of the HIF pathway in this manner results in the induction of target genes involved in erythropoiesis, such as those for EPO, EPO receptor, proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport and haem synthesis. Roxadustat dose-dependently increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, signifcantly reduced hepcidin levels and transiently increased endogenous EPO levels within or near physiological range in patients with anemia of CKD who were not dialysis dependent. Roxadustat reduced the dysregulation of iron metabolism associated with CKD by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in a dose-dependent manner in patients with anemia associated with dialysis dependent or dialysis-independent CKD. Cholesterol levels were also signifcantly reduced from baseline with roxadustat, regardless of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Reset overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Reset concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Reset. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Concurrent administration of Sutinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, Ketoconazole, resulted in 49% and 51% increases in the combined (Resinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of Sutinib in healthy volunteers. Coadministration of Sutinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Clarithromycin, Atazanavir, Indinavir, Nefazodone, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Telithromycin, Voriconazole) may increase Resinib concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase plasma s of Resinib. A dose reduction for Sutinib should be considered when it must be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. CYP3A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as Rifampin may decrease Resinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended. Concurrent administration of Sutinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, Rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction in the combined (Resinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of Sutinib in healthy volunteers. Coadministration of Sutinib with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., Dexamethasone, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentin, Phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) may decrease Resinib concentrations. St. John’s Wort may decrease Resinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving Sutinib should not take St. John’s Wort concomitantly. A dose increase for Sutinib should be considered when it must be coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers.",

Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

The pharmacologic efects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5 -adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. The precise mechanism through which futicasone furoate afects COPD and asthma symptoms is not known. Infammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in infammation. Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar afnity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological efects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.",

The use of Resurge is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although Resurge exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients. Patients who have received Resurge for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression or other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period based on the dose and duration of effect of the benzodiazepine employed. As patients with underlying hepatic impairment may experience delayed benzodiazepine effects, an extended observation period may be required. When Resurge is used with neuromuscular-blocking agents, it should not be injected until the effects of neuromuscular blockade have been fully reversed. Resurge should be used with caution in patients with head injury as it may be capable of precipitating convulsions or altering cerebral blood flow in patients receiving benzodiazepines. Rapid injection of Resurge should be avoided in patients with high dose and/or long-term exposure to benzodiazepines ending at any time within the weeks preceding Resurge administration as it may produce withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, emotional lability as well as mild confusion and sensory distortions. Resurge is not recommended either as a treatment for benzodiazepine dependence or for the management of protracted benzodiazepine abstinence syndromes. Resurge should be used with caution for the reversal of conscious sedation in children below the age of one year, for the management of overdose in children, for resuscitation of the newborn and for reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines used for induction of general anaesthesia in children, as experience is limited.",

        "information": "Ramosetron Hydrochloride is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Serotonin is a member of neurotransmitter which is greatly related to gastrointestinal motility, secretion and sensation. Stress may stimulate the serotonin release and activate the 5-HT3 receptors on enteric nerve, which induces the acceleration of intestinal transit resulting in diarrhea. In addition, the increase in intracolonic pressure also induces serotonin release, and it will bind to 5-HT3 receptor at the terminal of afferent neuron, causing intestinal nociceptive transmission to central nervous system. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves abnormal defecation associated with the acceleration of intestinal transit by inhibiting 5-HT3 receptor selectively. It also improves visceral hypersensitivity by suppressing the transmission of intestinal nociception. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves diarrhea by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the efferent nerves. It also improves abdominal pain by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the afferent nerves. Carcinostatics drugs such as cisplatin cause enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract to release serotonin. The released serotonin binds to 5-HT3 receptors present in the afferent vagal nerve-endings in the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the stimulation that is evoked induces emesis via the vomiting center. Ramosetron Hydrochloride is considered to exert its antiemetic action by blocking 5-HT3 receptors.",

Read moreRanflox is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Ranflox are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Ranflox has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Ranflox combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Ranflox to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.",

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Insulin Aspart can be given in mono therapy or in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs when the blood glucose is inadequately controlled with those oral antidiabetic drugs alone. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the recommended starting dose of Insulin Aspart is 6 IU at breakfast and 6 IU at dinner (evening meal). Insulin Aspart can also be initiated once daily with 12 IU at dinner (evening meal). When using Insulin Aspart once daily, it is generally recommended to move to twice-daily when reaching 30 units by splitting the dose into equal breakfast and dinner doses. If twice daily dosing with Insulin Aspart results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing). The dose should not be increased if hypoglycemia occurred within three days. Dose adjustments can be made once a week until target HbA1c is reached. In patients with type 1 diabetes the individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg/day. Insulin Aspart may fully or partially meet this requirement. When transferring a patient from biphasic human insulin to Insulin Aspart, start with the same dose and regimen. Then titrate according to individual needs (according to the titration guidelines in table above). Insulin Aspart can be used in elderly patients; however there is limited experience with the use of Insulin Aspart in combination with OADs in patients older than 75 years.",

At least five weeks should elapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of treatment with Rasagil. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of Rasagil and initiation of treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. The concomitant use of Rasagil and dextromethorphan or sympathomimetics such as, those present in nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal product containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is not recommended. During the clinical development program the occurrence of cases of melanoma prompted the consideration of a possible association with Rasagil. The data collected suggests that Parkinson's disease and not any medicinal products in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer (not exclusively melanoma). Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a specialist.",

Treatment: There is no specific antidote for Rasagil overdose. The following suggestions are offered: Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilator assistance, as required. Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of hyperpyrexia may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte imbalance is essential. For this reason, in cases of overdose with Rasagil, dietary tyramine restriction should be observed for several weeks to reduce the risk of hypertensive tyramine reaction.

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. While on corticosteroid therapy, patient should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, specially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack antibody response. Children who are on drugs, which suppress the immune system, are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids.",

In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Razosin ER has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms.

        "information": "Due to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Re 20 treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Re 20 is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Re 20 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Re 20 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Re 20 and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Re 20 is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Re 20 and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure.

It reduces gastrointestinal pH through stimulation of lactic-acid-producing bacteria; provide a direct antagonistic action on gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover it competes with pathogens for binding and receptor sites. In addition, there is emerging evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum appear to enhance the nonspecific immune phagocytic activity of circulating blood granulocytes. This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus. Lactic acid bacteria, like strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus have also demonstrated antioxidant ability. Mechanisms include chelation of metal ions (iron, copper), scavenging of reactive oxygen species and reducing activity.",

        "information": "Rebios are defined as live microorganisms, including Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species and yeasts, which may beneficially affect the host upon ingestion by improving the balance of the intestinal microflora. Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the several bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus. It gets its name from lacto-meaning milk, bacillus-meaning rod-like in shape and acidophilus-meaning acid-loving. L. acidophilus occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including dairy, grain, meat and fish. It is also present in human (and animal) intestines, mouths and vaginas. These types of healthy bacteria inhabit in the intestines and vaginas and protect against some unhealthy organisms. Lactobacillus bulgaricus is one of several bacteria used for the production of yogurt. First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov, it is named after Bulgaria. Morphologically, it is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is also non-motile and it does not form spores. The bacterium feeds on milk and produces lactic acid which also helps to preserve the milk. It breaks down lactose and is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance, whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars. While fermenting milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, which perfumes yogurt. Bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human and animal colon. Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria within days after birth. Bifidobacteria were first isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants. They are gram-positive anaerobes, non-motile, non spore forming and catalase-negative. Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a 'Y'-shaped or bifid form. To date 30 species of bifidobacteria have been isolated.",
