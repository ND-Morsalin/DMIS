Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.",

        "information": "As in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces Texicam from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of Texicam. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Texicam is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Texicam may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Texicam should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Texicam and furosemide was noted, but Texicam attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Texicam might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Texicam was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Texicam and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Texicam. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Texicam and low molecular weight heparin.",

Texicam inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Texicam has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Texicam is administered. Any patient being treated with Texicam who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Texicam should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Texicam. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Texicam, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced.

It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",

Thiopental is an ultrashort-acting depressant of the central nervous system which induces hypnosis and anesthesia, but not analgesia. It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl - ionopore at the GABA A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl - ionopore is open.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

        "information": "This tablet contains synthetic Levothyroxine (also called Thyroxine or T4) which is identical to the natural hormone T4, produced in the Thyroid gland. About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

As with other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, this drug may be absorbed systemically and lead to systemic effects of beta blockers. So cardiac insufficiency should be adequately controlled before starting therapy with Timolol Maleate. In patients with a history of severe cardiac disease and in elderly patients, signs of cardiac insufficiency should be watched for and pulse rates should be checked. Patients already receiving a beta-blacker orally and who are given Timolol Maleate should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta-blockers.

The range of action of econazole covers all dermatomycoses caused by the following pathogens:- Dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Cladosporium, Yeasts, such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Moulds, Fungi, such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomycosis dermatitidis, and others. As well as Malassezia furfur and Nocardia minutissima. Moreover, it has antibacterial effect on gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Streptococcus pyogens and Staphylococcus aureus. It is also effective against Trichomonus vaginalis, versicolor and balanitis. On the other hand Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic steroid which inhibits not only the early phenomena of the inflammatory process but also the later manifestations. Pharmacological Properties: Econazole Nitrate is only slightly (<0.1%) absorbed from the skin. So no active drug has been detected in the serum. But Triamcinolone Acetonide is well absorbed from sites of local application.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect.",

Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect. Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",

Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

        "information": "This is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants.

In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours.",

When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons. Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action",

An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted in neonatal CNS depression following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy. Reproduction studies in animals with temazepam were performed in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal-postnatal study in rats, oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day resulted in increasing nursling mortality. Teratology studies in rats demonstrated increased fetal resorptions at doses of 30 and 120 mg/kg in one study and increased occurrence of rudimentary ribs, which are considered skeletal variants, in a second study at doses of 240 mg/kg or higher. In rabbits, occasional abnormalities such as exencephaly and fusion or asymmetry of ribs were reported without dose relationship. Although these abnormalities were not found in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg or higher, there was an increased incidence of the 13th rib variant when compared to the incidence in concurrent and historical controls. Temazepam is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Temol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Temol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Temol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Tempol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour.

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Tempol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin). Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a β1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic.

Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals.

        "information": "As in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces Tenopain from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of Tenopain. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Tenopain is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Tenopain may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Tenopain should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Tenopain and furosemide was noted, but Tenopain attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Tenopain might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Tenopain was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Tenopain and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Tenopain. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Tenopain and low molecular weight heparin.",

Tenopain inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Tenopain has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Tenopain is administered. Any patient being treated with Tenopain who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Tenopain should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Tenopain. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Tenopain, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced. In common with anti-inflammatory drugs, Tenopain may mask the usual signs of infection. Tenopain Tablets should not be given to patients who either dislike or do not tolerate milk products.",

Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals.

Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Tenoxim is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Tenoxim may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Tenoxim should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Tenoxim and furosemide was noted, but Tenoxim attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Tenoxim might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Tenoxim was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Tenoxim and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Tenoxim. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Tenoxim and low molecular weight heparin.",

If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Tenoxim should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Tenoxim. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances.

Tepadina appears to be metabolised via CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Co-administration with inhibitors of CYP2B6 (for example clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or CYP3A4 (for example azole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and protease inhibitors) may increase the plasma concentrations of Tepadina and potentially decrease the concentrations of the active metabolite TEPA. Co-administration of inducers of cytochrome P450 (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) may increase the metabolism of Tepadina leading to increased plasma concentrations of the active metabolite. Therefore, during the concomitant use of Tepadina and these medicinal products, patients should be carefully monitored clinically. Tepadina is a weak inhibitor for CYP2B6, and may thereby potentially increase plasma concentrations of substances metabolised via CYP2B6, such as ifosfamide, tamoxifen, bupropion, efavirenz and cyclophosphamide. CYP2B6 catalyzes the metabolic conversion of cyclophosphamide to its active form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP) and co-administration of Tepadina may therefore lead to decreased concentrations of the active 4 OHCP. Therefore, a clinical monitoring should be exercised during the concomitant use of Tepadina and these medicinal products.",

Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra. It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells. Treatment with terazosin enhances the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), which upregulates p27kip1, and the caspase cascade",

A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Terlipressin Acetate should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Terlipressin Acetate therapy to the woman.",

Isoflurane has a mild pungency which limits the rate of induction, although excessive salivation or tracheobronchial secretions do not appear to be stimulated. Pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are readily obtunded. Isoflurane is a profound respiratory depressant. As anesthetic dose is increased, tidal volume decreases and respiratory rate is unchanged. This depression is partially reversed by surgical stimulation, even at deeper levels of anesthesia. Isoflurane evokes a sigh response reminiscent of that seen with diethyl ether and enflurane, although the frequency is less than with enflurane. Blood pressure decreases with induction of anesthesia but returns toward normal with surgical stimulation. Progressive increases in depth of anesthesia produce corresponding decreases in blood pressure. Nitrous oxide diminishes the inspiratory concentration of isoflurane required to reach a desired level of anesthesia and may reduce the arterial hypotension seen with isoflurane alone. With controlled ventilation and normal PaC0 2 , cardiac output is maintained despite increasing depth of anesthesia, primarily through an increase in heart rate which compensates for a reduction in stroke volume. The hypercapnia which attends spontaneous ventilation during isoflurane anesthesia further increases heart rate and raises cardiac output above awake levels. All commonly used muscle relaxants are markedly potentiated with isoflurane, the effect being most profound with the nondepolarizing type. Neostigmine reverses the effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in the presence of isoflurane. All commonly used muscle relaxants are compatible with isoflurane.",

In general, anesthetic concentrations of Terrell at equilibrium reduce the ED95 of succinylcholine, atracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium.

If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents, administer intravenous dantrolene sodium and initiate supportive therapies. Cases of mild, moderate and severe postoperative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice, including fatal hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported with Terrell. QTc prolongation, with rare instances of torsade de pointes, have been reported. Monitor QT interval when administering Terrell to susceptible patients. All patients anesthetized with Terrell should be continually monitored. Respiration should be closely monitored and assisted or controlled ventilation employed when necessary. Maintenance of normal hemodynamics is important to the avoidance of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Consider additional cardiac monitoring in patients with known coronary artery disease, as clinically necessary. Particular care must be taken when selecting the dosage for patients who are hypovolemic, hypotensive or otherwise hemodynamically compromised, e.g., due to concomitant medications. In patients with or at risk for elevations of intracranial pressure (ICP), administer Terrell in conjunction with ICP reducing strategies, as clinically appropriate. When a clinician suspects that CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced before the administration of Terrell.

An additional 0.5 to 1.0% may be required when isoflurane is given using oxygen alone. If added relaxation is required, supplemental doses of muscle relaxants may be used.

Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.",

Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of Thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma.

Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",

Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",

It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

        "information": "This tablet contains synthetic Levothyroxine (also called Thyroxine or T4) which is identical to the natural hormone T4, produced in the Thyroid gland. About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

        "information": "This tablet contains synthetic Levothyroxine (also called Thyroxine or T4) which is identical to the natural hormone T4, produced in the Thyroid gland. About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo. In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.",

Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect. Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",

Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Tenicar, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Tenicar and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Tenicar may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.",

Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles.

Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.",

Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.",

        "information": "As in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces Tenorix from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of Tenorix. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Tenorix is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Tenorix may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Tenorix should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Tenorix and furosemide was noted, but Tenorix attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Tenorix might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Tenorix was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Tenorix and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Tenorix. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Tenorix and low molecular weight heparin.",

Tenorix inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Tenorix has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Tenorix is administered. Any patient being treated with Tenorix who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Tenorix should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Tenorix. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Tenorix, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced.

Clobazam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal studies have demonstrated reproductive toxicity. Clobazam crosses the placenta. In the post-marketing safety database, limited data on exposed pregnancies are available with clobazam. A large amount of data collected from cohort studies has not demonstrated evidence of the occurrence of malformations following exposure to benzodiazepines during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, in certain epidemiological case-control studies, an increased incidence of cleft lip and palate was observed with benzodiazepines. Cases of reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability have been described after administration of benzodiazepines during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. Administration of clobazam during the late phase of pregnancy or during childbirth can result in the occurrence of neonatal respiratory depression (including respiratory distress and apnea), which may be associated with other disorders such as sedation signs, hypothermia, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties (which may result in poor weight gain) in the newborn (signs and symptoms of the so-called \"floppy infant syndrome\"). Moreover, infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines over longer periods during the later stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at risk of developing a withdrawal syndrome in the postnatal period. Appropriate monitoring of the newborn in the postnatal period is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should be informed of the risks and benefits of the use of Clobazam during pregnancy. If a woman plans a pregnancy or becomes pregnant, carefully evaluate the risks and benefits and whether treatment with Clobazam should be discontinued. If Clobazam treatment is to be continued, use Clobazam at the lowest effective dose.",

Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra. It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells.

Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.",

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

Tenofovir alafenamide as a lipophilic cell-permeant compound enters primary hepatocytes by passive diffusion and by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Tenofovir alafenamide is then converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis primarily by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary hepatocytes. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in cell culture.",

Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of Thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells.",

It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl - ionopore at the GABA A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl - ionopore is open.

It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl - ionopore at the GABA A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl - ionopore is open.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

        "information": "This tablet contains synthetic Levothyroxine (also called Thyroxine or T4) which is identical to the natural hormone T4, produced in the Thyroid gland. About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.",

Tibolone substitutes for the loss of estrogen production in postmenopausal women and alleviates menopausal symptoms. It prevents bone loss following menopause or ovariectomy. It has estrogenic effects on the vagina, on bone and on the thermoregulatory centers in the brain (hot flushes). It improves vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Tibolone has also effects on mood and libido.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related.

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Timidal overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Timidal concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Timidal. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium.In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Theanti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstratedin human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene.

Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect. Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",

Its principal site of action is the spinal cord, where the evidence suggests that, by stimulating presynaptic alpha2 receptors, it inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids that stimulate N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect. Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",

This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence. Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",

(3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway. Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.",

        "information": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL7, IL15, IL21, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta. (3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway. Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",

When applied topically, Fusidic Acid is effective against Staphylococci, Streptococci, Corynebacteria, Neisseria and certain Clostridia & Bacteroides. Fusidic Acid is an antimicrobial agent that acts as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the microorganism. It interferes with translocation step by stabilizing the ribosome-guanosine diphosphate elongation factor G-complex. This prevents binding of aminoacyl t-RNA to the ribosome and thereafter stops transfer of additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide. In humans, Hydrocortisone is the principal naturally occurring glucocorticosteroid. In pharmaceutical dosage, its main action is to reduce the response of the skin to injury (i.e. anti-in ammatory). It also has immuno suppressant & anti-mitotic actions.",

This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures. The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors. Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.",

This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures. The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors. Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.",

This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures. The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors. Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.",

Hypertension and/or flushing have also been reported. Blood pressure usually normalizes within a few hours after cessation of the infusion. Anaphylactic like reactions have occurred during the initial infusion of Toposide. Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis, tightness in throat, laryngospasm, back pain, and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in association with the above reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity-associated apnea has been reported rarely. Rash, urticaria, and/or pruritus have infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At investigational doses, a generalized pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with perivasculitis, has been reported.

        "information": "Patients being treated with Toposide must be frequently observed for myelosuppression both during and after therapy. Myelosuppression resulting in death has been reported. Dose limiting bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with Toposide therapy. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent cycle of Toposide: platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and differential. The occurrence of a platelet count below 50,000/mm 3 or an absolute neutrophil count below 500/mm 3 is an indication to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction manifested by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. Higher rates of anaphylactic- like reactions have been reported in children who received infusions at concentrations higher than those recommended. The role that concentration of infusion (or rate of infusion) plays in the development of anaphylactic-like reactions is uncertain. Treatment is symptomatic. The infusion should be terminated immediately, followed by the administration of presser agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician. For parenteral administration, Toposide should be given only by slow intravenous infusion (usually over a 30 to 60 minute period) since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of rapid intravenous injection In all instances where the use of Toposide is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. If severe reactions occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of Toposide therapy should be carried out with caution, and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity. Patients with low serum albumin may be at an increased risk for Toposide associated toxicities.",

The susceptible organisms include gram-positive bacteria eg. S. aureus (including penicillinase producing strains), S. saprophyticus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, P. magnus and gram-negative bacteria eg. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae (including β-lactamase producer & Ampicillin resistant strains), M. catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase producing strains), P. mirabilis, C. diversus, H. parainfluenzae, K. oxytoca, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri.",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

Tenecteplase binds to fibrin rich clots via the fibronectin finger-like domain and the Kringle 2 domain. The protease domain then cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin.

Tenectaplase is a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for single intravenous (IV) bolus administration after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), USP. Each vial of Tenectaplase nominally contains 52.5 mg Tplase, 0.55 g L-arginine, 0.17 g phosphoric acid, and 4.3 mg polysorbate 20, which includes a 5% overfill. Each vial will deliver 50 mg of Tplase.",

Three of 487 patients tested for antibody formation to Tenecteplase had a positive antibody titer at 30 days. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to Tenecteplase in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Tenecteplase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Although sustained antibody formation in patients receiving one dose of Tenecteplase has not been documented, readministration should be undertaken with caution.",

Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl - ionopore at the GABA A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl - ionopore is open.

Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

Tranexamic acid is a substance endowed with a strong antifibrinolytic action and both in vivo and in vitro it has proved to be 10 times more active than conventional hemostatics, depending on the test. The antihemorrhagic action of tranexamic acid is essentially due to an inhibition of the plasminogen activation of both exogenous activators like streptokinase and endogenous ones like urokinase and the plasminogen tissue activator. This fact is particularly important for the clinical use of Tranexamic Acid, because it ensures an antihemorrhagic activity with an antifibrinolytic mechanism under a variety of conditions. The acute toxicity of Tranexamic Acid is extremely low and chronic toxicity almost non-existent. Tranexamic Acid is well absorbed by oral route and the effect is already seen 15-30 minutes after administration. It is excreted mainly by renal route but more slowly than conventional hemostatics. These features make the Tranexamic Acid effect more lasting than those conventional hemostatics. Considerably lower single doses of Tranexamic Acid can thus be administered at greater intervals without the drug plasma levels dropping to inefficient levels of antifibrinolytic activity between one dose and the other. Tranexamic Acid at therapeutic doses does not interfere with clotting processes and even a prolonged administration has not been seen to be accompanied by any tendency to thrombophilia.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",

(3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway. Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.",

This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence. Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",

This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence. Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.",

It is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and exerts its effects in 15-30 minutes after oral administration. The duration of action is approximately 3-6 hours with conventional dosage form. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is extensively metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine as unchanged Dextromethorphan and demethylated metabolites including Dextrophan which has some cough suppressant activity. Urinary excretion of parent and metabolites accounts for up to 50% of the ingested dose over 24 hours. About 8% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine over the first 6 hours.",

In addition to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, it stabilizes lysosomal membranes in vitro and in vivo, inhibits leukotriene synthesis in vitro at high concentrations, and also exhibits antibradykinin activity in vivo. Ketoprofen produces analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins peripherally and centrally. It has also been suggested that Ketoprofen causes the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS (probably in the hypothalamus) leading to its antipyretic effect. Ketoprofen is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract. It is approximately 99% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin. Following single or multiple oral doses in healthy adults, the elimination half-life of the drug has averaged 1.1-4 hours. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver, principally via conjugation with glucoronic acid. Following a single oral dose of Ketoprofen in healthy adults, about 50-90% of the drug is excreted in urine and about 1-8% in faeces within 1-5 days ; most urinary excretion occurs within 12-24 hours and most faecal excretion occurs within 24-48 hours. In case of IM injection, peak concentration of approximately 10 mg/L is reached at about 0.5-0.75 hour after a 100 mg dose. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.88 hour.",

In addition to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, it stabilizes lysosomal membranes in vitro and in vivo, inhibits leukotriene synthesis in vitro at high concentrations, and also exhibits antibradykinin activity in vivo. Ketoprofen produces analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins peripherally and centrally. It has also been suggested that Ketoprofen causes the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS (probably in the hypothalamus) leading to its antipyretic effect. Ketoprofen is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract. It is approximately 99% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin. Following single or multiple oral doses in healthy adults, the elimination half-life of the drug has averaged 1.1-4 hours. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver, principally via conjugation with glucoronic acid. Following a single oral dose of Ketoprofen in healthy adults, about 50-90% of the drug is excreted in urine and about 1-8% in faeces within 1-5 days ; most urinary excretion occurs within 12-24 hours and most faecal excretion occurs within 24-48 hours. In case of IM injection, peak concentration of approximately 10 mg/L is reached at about 0.5-0.75 hour after a 100 mg dose. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.88 hour.",

Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapases, development of tolearance, risk of generalisedpustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis, careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of antimicrobial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied. Avoid contact with broken or inflammed skin. Salicylate toxicity may occur if applied to large areas of skin or to the skin of neonates.",
