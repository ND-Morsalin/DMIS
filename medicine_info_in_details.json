The bioavailability of these agents may be restored by separating the administration of these agents from Protecto by two hours. This interaction appears to be non-systemic in origin presumably resulting from these agents being bound by Protecto in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the potential of Protecto to alter the absorption of some drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, the separate administration of Protecto from that of other agents should be considered when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical for concomitantly administered drugs. Protecto should not be co-administered with citrate preparations. Co-administration citrate preparations with Protecto may increase the blood concentrations of aluminium. The mechanism may be due to the chelation of aluminium which is assumed to increase its absorption. The administration of Protecto 1 g and enteral feeds by nasogastric tube should be separated by one hour in patients receiving Protecto 1 g for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration.

This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:",

Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.",

Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.",

Ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.

It may improve lung function and reduce the number of acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The precise mechanism of action of pirfenidone and its specific molecular targets have yet to be elucidated. One vital anti-fibrotic mechanism involves the suppression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a key cytokine involved in fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix production. There is also evidence to suggest that pirfenidone has the ability to downregulate the expression of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma. In animal models, pirfenidone can inhibit both the influx of inflammatory cells and the increased pulmonary vascular permeability induced by bleomycin.",

It may improve lung function and reduce the number of acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The precise mechanism of action of pirfenidone and its specific molecular targets have yet to be elucidated. One vital anti-fibrotic mechanism involves the suppression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a key cytokine involved in fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix production. There is also evidence to suggest that pirfenidone has the ability to downregulate the expression of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma. In animal models, pirfenidone can inhibit both the influx of inflammatory cells and the increased pulmonary vascular permeability induced by bleomycin.",

It may improve lung function and reduce the number of acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The precise mechanism of action of pirfenidone and its specific molecular targets have yet to be elucidated. One vital anti-fibrotic mechanism involves the suppression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a key cytokine involved in fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix production. There is also evidence to suggest that pirfenidone has the ability to downregulate the expression of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma. In animal models, pirfenidone can inhibit both the influx of inflammatory cells and the increased pulmonary vascular permeability induced by bleomycin.",

One vital anti-fibrotic mechanism involves the suppression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a key cytokine involved in fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix production. There is also evidence to suggest that pirfenidone has the ability to downregulate the expression of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma.

Pharmacokinetics: Dexibuprofen is absorbed primarily from the small intestine. After metabolic transformation in the liver (hydroxylation, carboxylation) the pharmacologically inactive metabolites are completely excreted, mainly by the kidneys (90%), but also in the bile. The elimination half-life is 1.8-3.5 hours; the plasma protein binding is about 99%. Maximum plasma levels are reached about 2 hours after oral administration. The administration of dexibuprofen with a meal delays the time to reach maximum concentrations (from 2.1 hours after fasting conditions to 2.8 hours after non-fasting conditions) and decreases the maximum plasma concentrations (from 20.6 to 18.1 mcg/ml, which is of no clinical relevance), but has no effect on the extent of absorption.",

Activation of β2 adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. This increase in cAMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. Levosalbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.

In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Following intravenous administration of Paclitaxel, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner. The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartment and elimination of the drug. The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Pyralgin overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Pyralgin concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Pyralgin. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Pyralgin overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Pyralgin concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Pyralgin. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5HT 2 antagonism.

However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5HT 2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors may explain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.",

It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Quinox are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Quinox has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Quinox combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Quinox to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

The recommended first-aid measures consist of immediate flushing and washing of the wound with soap and water, detergent or other substance of proven lethal effect on rabies virus. The rabies immune globulin should be injected as soon as possible after exposure. The recommended dose for both adults and children is 40 IU/kg of body weight. If anatomically feasible, as much as possible of the dose should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s). The remainder should be administered intramuscularly (into the gluteal region) in a single injection. However, for children, particularly in the case of multiple wounds, it has been proposed to dilute the dose 2-3 times in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a sufficient quantity of equine rabies immune globulin to infiltrate the wound(s) correctly. Wounds in certain anatomical sites (fingertips) should be infiltrated with care so as to prevent a local increase in pressure in the tissue. For prevention of rabies, combined immune globulin-vaccine treatment is recommended. The 1st dose of the rabies vaccine should be given at the same time as the Rabies immunoglobulin, but in different parts of the body. If Rabies immunoglobulin is not available when the rabies vaccine is administered, it can be administered up to the 7th or 8th day after the first dose of rabies vaccine. When indicated, begin anti-tetanus treatment and administer anti-microbial drugs to control infections other than rabies. The WHO expert committee on rabies has issued the following therapeutic recommendations: Category Type of contact with a suspect or confirmed rabid domestic or wild animal or animal not available for observation Recommended Treatment: Single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches specially on head, neck, shoulder girdle,arms or hands. Contamination of mucus membrane with saliva (i.e. licks on broken skin).

It is active against most gram negative aerobic bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.",

Ralozine SR may be used with beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. It has been shown to decrease angina episodes in patients with coronary artery disease on maximal doses of amlodipine. Because Ralozine SR prolongs the QT interval, it should be reserved for patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other antianginal drugs.The effect on angina rate or exercise tolerance appeared to be smaller in women than men.",

It is particularly active against Salmonella typhi and Haemophilus influenzae. The mode of actions is through interference or inhibition of protein synthesis in intact cells and cell-free systems. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin and lincomycin. Chloramphenicol is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. Chloramphenicol palmitate is hydrolyzed in the GI tract and is absorbed as free chloramphenicol. Following oral administration of a single one gram dose of chloramphenicol base to healthy adults, average peak plasma chloramphenicol concentrations of about 11 mcg/ml were attained with 1-3 hours. Cumulative dosing gave a peak of 18 mcg/ml after the fifth dose of one gram, every 6 hours. Mean serum levels were 8-14 mcg/ml over a 48 hour period. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine. Despite the small proportion of unchanged drug excreted in the urine, the concentration of free chloramphenicol in the urine is relatively high. From 8% to 12% of the antibiotic is excreted as free chloramphenicol. The remainder is excreted as inert metabolites, mainly glucuronate. Small amounts of active drug are found in bile and feces. Chloramphenicol diffuses rapidly, but its distribution is not uniform. Highest concentrations are found in liver and kidney, and lowest concentrations are found in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Chloramphenicol enters CSF even in the absence of meningeal inflammation, appearing in concentrations about half of those found in the blood.",

As Rampro is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Rampro 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Rampro 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Rampro and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Rampro is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Rampro and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H + /k + -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.",

Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Razosin ER has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms.

This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Realzid treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Realzid has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Realzid is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Realzid is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled. This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.",

        "information": "Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent which decreases blood glucose concentration. The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of beta cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion. In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

As soon as an overdose of glimepiride has been discovered, a physician must be notifed without delay. The patient must immediately take sugar, if possible in the form of glucose unless a physician has already undertaken responsibility for treating the overdose. Careful monitoring is essential until the physician is confdent that the patient is out of danger. It must be remembered that hypoglycaemia may recur after initial recovery. Admission to hospital may sometimes be necessary even as a precautionary measure. In particular, signifcant overdoses and severe reactions with signs such as loss of consciousness or other serious neurological disorders are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment and admission to hospital. If, for example, the patient is unconscious, an intravenous injection of concentrated glucose solution is indicated (for adults starting with 40 ml of 20% solution, for example). Alternatively in adults, administration of glucagon, e.g. in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg i.v., s.c. or i.m., may be considered. In particular when treating hypoglycaemia due to accidental intake of glimepiride in infants and young children, the dose of glucose given must be very carefully adjusted in view of the possibility of producing dangerous hyperglycaemia, and must be controlled by close monitoring of blood glucose. Patients who have ingested life-threatening amounts of glimepiride require detoxifcation (e.g. by gastric lavage and medicinal charcoal). After acute glucose replacement has been completed it is usually necessary to give an intravenous glucose infusion in lower concentration so as to ensure that the hypoglycaemia does not recur. The patient's blood glucose level should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hours.

Glucosamine hydrochloride is a prodrug for glucosamine that is well absorbed after oral administration and diffuses into several tissues, including bones and articular cartilages. The active ingredient in the treatment of osteoarthritis is glucosamine. The hydrochloride acid salt is the delivery vehicle. Once it has entered the stomach, after oral administration the salt's job is done and it is the glucosamine that is released to perform its function. Data supports Glucosamine as the first anti-osteoarthritic drug that treats both sign and symptoms of osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliances.",

It is essential that qualified personnel and adequate facilities are available for the treatment of postoperative respiratory depression. Respiratory depression will abate approximately 10 minutes after the discontinuation of a Remifentanil infusion. Administration of the narcotic antagonist, naloxone, has not been shown to be more effective or more prompt in reversing respiratory depression than the discontinuation of Remifentanil. Naloxone can be used to manage severe respiratory depression or muscle rigidity. Bolus doses of Remifentanil should not be administered to patients who are spontaneously breathing and also receiving a continuous infusion of Remifentanil. Administration of Remifentanil at a rate greater than 0.2 mcg/kg/min is usually associated with hypoventilation (respiratory rate of less than 8 breaths/minute). The manufacturer strongly recommends that supplemental oxygen be supplied whenever Remifentanil is administered. Analgesic effects will dissipate within 5 to 10 minutes after discontinuation of Remifentanil. Adequate postoperative analgesia should be established prior to discontinuation of Remifentanil. The intravenous tubing supplying the Remifentanil infusion should be cleared of residual drug after the discontinuation of therapy.

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that REMMO does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. REMMO may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major REMMO metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of REMMO 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. REMMO inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, REMMO may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of REMMO. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of REMMO, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of REMMO and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Infliximab does not neutralize TNFα (lymphotoxin-α), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFα. Biological activities attributed to TNFα include: induction of pro inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, enhancement of leukocyte migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, induction of acute phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes. Cells expressing transmembrane TNFα bound by infliximab can be lysed in vitro or in vivo. Infliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNFα in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays utilizing human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and T lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanism(s) by which Infliximab exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Anti-TNFα antibodies reduce disease activity in the cotton-top tamarin colitis model, and decrease synovitis and joint erosions in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. Infliximab prevents disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human TNFα, and when administered after disease onset, allows eroded joints to heal.",

Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate.

Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia.

Temporarily discontinue Linagliptin & Metformin in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. Metformin may lower Vitamin B12 levels; so hematologic parameters shoud be monitored annually. Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause lactic acidosis. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and quick to appear, and usually occur when other health problems not related to the medicine are present and are very severe, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. Be sure to drink extra fluids when you exercise or increase your activity or if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Pancreatitis may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a fever, or lightheadedness. Need to temporarily stop taking this medicine before you have major surgery or diagnostic tests including procedures that use contrast dye. It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about: Linagliptin and metformin combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take linagliptin and metformin combination with another type of diabetes medicine. The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people feel different symptoms of low blood sugar.

Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5HT 2 antagonism.

Upon administration, roxadustat binds to and inhibits HIF-PH, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of transcription factors in the HIF family under normal oxygen conditions. This prevents HIF breakdown and promotes HIF activity. Increased HIF activity leads to an increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, thereby enhancing erythropoiesis. It also reduces the expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin, improves iron availability, and boosts hemoglobin (Hb) levels. HIF regulates the expression of genes in response to reduced oxygen levels, including genes required for erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. Administration of roxadustat has been shown to induce coordinated erythropoiesis, increasing red blood cell count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within or near normal physiologic range, in multiple subpopulations of CKD patients, including in the presence of infammation, and without a need for supplemental intravenous iron. Roxadustat reversibly binds to and potently inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, reducing HIF-α breakdown and promoting HIF transcriptional activity. Activation of the HIF pathway in this manner results in the induction of target genes involved in erythropoiesis, such as those for EPO, EPO receptor, proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport and haem synthesis. Roxadustat dose-dependently increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, signifcantly reduced hepcidin levels and transiently increased endogenous EPO levels within or near physiological range in patients with anemia of CKD who were not dialysis dependent. Roxadustat reduced the dysregulation of iron metabolism associated with CKD by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in a dose-dependent manner in patients with anemia associated with dialysis dependent or dialysis-independent CKD. Cholesterol levels were also signifcantly reduced from baseline with roxadustat, regardless of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents.",

Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors. In patients treated with Finerenone, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1-2 mmHg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter. At a dose 4 times the maximum approved recommended dose, Finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone C max was achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing. Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1.25 to 80 mg (0.06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage).

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

Upon administration, roxadustat binds to and inhibits HIF-PH, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of transcription factors in the HIF family under normal oxygen conditions. This prevents HIF breakdown and promotes HIF activity. Increased HIF activity leads to an increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, thereby enhancing erythropoiesis. It also reduces the expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin, improves iron availability, and boosts hemoglobin (Hb) levels. HIF regulates the expression of genes in response to reduced oxygen levels, including genes required for erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. Administration of roxadustat has been shown to induce coordinated erythropoiesis, increasing red blood cell count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within or near normal physiologic range, in multiple subpopulations of CKD patients, including in the presence of infammation, and without a need for supplemental intravenous iron. Roxadustat reversibly binds to and potently inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, reducing HIF-α breakdown and promoting HIF transcriptional activity. Activation of the HIF pathway in this manner results in the induction of target genes involved in erythropoiesis, such as those for EPO, EPO receptor, proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport and haem synthesis. Roxadustat dose-dependently increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, signifcantly reduced hepcidin levels and transiently increased endogenous EPO levels within or near physiological range in patients with anemia of CKD who were not dialysis dependent. Roxadustat reduced the dysregulation of iron metabolism associated with CKD by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in a dose-dependent manner in patients with anemia associated with dialysis dependent or dialysis-independent CKD. Cholesterol levels were also signifcantly reduced from baseline with roxadustat, regardless of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents.",

These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Reset overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Reset concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Reset. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.",

Ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

The use of Resurge is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although Resurge exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients. Patients who have received Resurge for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression or other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period based on the dose and duration of effect of the benzodiazepine employed. As patients with underlying hepatic impairment may experience delayed benzodiazepine effects, an extended observation period may be required. When Resurge is used with neuromuscular-blocking agents, it should not be injected until the effects of neuromuscular blockade have been fully reversed. Resurge should be used with caution in patients with head injury as it may be capable of precipitating convulsions or altering cerebral blood flow in patients receiving benzodiazepines. Rapid injection of Resurge should be avoided in patients with high dose and/or long-term exposure to benzodiazepines ending at any time within the weeks preceding Resurge administration as it may produce withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, emotional lability as well as mild confusion and sensory distortions. Resurge is not recommended either as a treatment for benzodiazepine dependence or for the management of protracted benzodiazepine abstinence syndromes. Resurge should be used with caution for the reversal of conscious sedation in children below the age of one year, for the management of overdose in children, for resuscitation of the newborn and for reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines used for induction of general anaesthesia in children, as experience is limited.",

Serotonin is a member of neurotransmitter which is greatly related to gastrointestinal motility, secretion and sensation. Stress may stimulate the serotonin release and activate the 5-HT3 receptors on enteric nerve, which induces the acceleration of intestinal transit resulting in diarrhea. In addition, the increase in intracolonic pressure also induces serotonin release, and it will bind to 5-HT3 receptor at the terminal of afferent neuron, causing intestinal nociceptive transmission to central nervous system. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves abnormal defecation associated with the acceleration of intestinal transit by inhibiting 5-HT3 receptor selectively. It also improves visceral hypersensitivity by suppressing the transmission of intestinal nociception. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves diarrhea by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the efferent nerves. It also improves abdominal pain by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the afferent nerves. Carcinostatics drugs such as cisplatin cause enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract to release serotonin. The released serotonin binds to 5-HT3 receptors present in the afferent vagal nerve-endings in the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the stimulation that is evoked induces emesis via the vomiting center. Ramosetron Hydrochloride is considered to exert its antiemetic action by blocking 5-HT3 receptors.",

Serotonin is a member of neurotransmitter which is greatly related to gastrointestinal motility, secretion and sensation. Stress may stimulate the serotonin release and activate the 5-HT3 receptors on enteric nerve, which induces the acceleration of intestinal transit resulting in diarrhea. In addition, the increase in intracolonic pressure also induces serotonin release, and it will bind to 5-HT3 receptor at the terminal of afferent neuron, causing intestinal nociceptive transmission to central nervous system. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves abnormal defecation associated with the acceleration of intestinal transit by inhibiting 5-HT3 receptor selectively. It also improves visceral hypersensitivity by suppressing the transmission of intestinal nociception. Ramosetron Hydrochloride improves diarrhea by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the efferent nerves. It also improves abdominal pain by exerting an opposing effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptors on the afferent nerves. Carcinostatics drugs such as cisplatin cause enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract to release serotonin. The released serotonin binds to 5-HT3 receptors present in the afferent vagal nerve-endings in the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the stimulation that is evoked induces emesis via the vomiting center. Ramosetron Hydrochloride is considered to exert its antiemetic action by blocking 5-HT3 receptors.",

It is active against most gram negative aerobic bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.",

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Insulin Aspart can be given in mono therapy or in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs when the blood glucose is inadequately controlled with those oral antidiabetic drugs alone. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the recommended starting dose of Insulin Aspart is 6 IU at breakfast and 6 IU at dinner (evening meal). Insulin Aspart can also be initiated once daily with 12 IU at dinner (evening meal). When using Insulin Aspart once daily, it is generally recommended to move to twice-daily when reaching 30 units by splitting the dose into equal breakfast and dinner doses. If twice daily dosing with Insulin Aspart results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing). The dose should not be increased if hypoglycemia occurred within three days. Dose adjustments can be made once a week until target HbA1c is reached. In patients with type 1 diabetes the individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg/day. Insulin Aspart may fully or partially meet this requirement. When transferring a patient from biphasic human insulin to Insulin Aspart, start with the same dose and regimen. Then titrate according to individual needs (according to the titration guidelines in table above). Insulin Aspart can be used in elderly patients; however there is limited experience with the use of Insulin Aspart in combination with OADs in patients older than 75 years.",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.",

In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Razosin ER has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms.

As Re 20 is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Re 20 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Re 20 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Re 20 and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Re 20 is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Re 20 and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped.

It reduces gastrointestinal pH through stimulation of lactic-acid-producing bacteria; provide a direct antagonistic action on gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover it competes with pathogens for binding and receptor sites. In addition, there is emerging evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum appear to enhance the nonspecific immune phagocytic activity of circulating blood granulocytes. This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus. Lactic acid bacteria, like strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus have also demonstrated antioxidant ability. Mechanisms include chelation of metal ions (iron, copper), scavenging of reactive oxygen species and reducing activity.",

        "information": "Rebios are defined as live microorganisms, including Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species and yeasts, which may beneficially affect the host upon ingestion by improving the balance of the intestinal microflora. Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the several bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus. It gets its name from lacto-meaning milk, bacillus-meaning rod-like in shape and acidophilus-meaning acid-loving. L. acidophilus occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including dairy, grain, meat and fish. It is also present in human (and animal) intestines, mouths and vaginas. These types of healthy bacteria inhabit in the intestines and vaginas and protect against some unhealthy organisms. Lactobacillus bulgaricus is one of several bacteria used for the production of yogurt. First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov, it is named after Bulgaria. Morphologically, it is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is also non-motile and it does not form spores. The bacterium feeds on milk and produces lactic acid which also helps to preserve the milk. It breaks down lactose and is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance, whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars. While fermenting milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, which perfumes yogurt. Bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human and animal colon. Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria within days after birth. Bifidobacteria were first isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants. They are gram-positive anaerobes, non-motile, non spore forming and catalase-negative. Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a 'Y'-shaped or bifid form. To date 30 species of bifidobacteria have been isolated.",
