        "information": "Clozapine is classified as an 'atypical' antipsychotic drug because of its profile of binding to dopamine receptors and its effects on various dopamine-mediated behaviors differ from those exhibited by other typical antipsychotic drug products. In particular, although Clozapine does interfere with the binding of dopamine at D1, D2, D3 and D5 receptors, and has a high affinity for the D4 receptor. This evidence, consistent with the view that Clozapine is preferentially more active at limbic than at striatal dopamine receptors. This may explain the relative freedom of Clozapine from extrapyramidal side effects. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors.",

        "information": "Myelosuppression may be aggravated with concomitant use of myelosuppressants. Cope may interact with other CNS active drugs or alcohol. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with benzodiazepine usage or other psychotropics. Since Cope is highly bound to proteins. It may be displaced by other drugs, which are also highly protein bound. Conversely, Cope may also displace protein bound drugs (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). Cimetidine may decrease plasma Cope levels. Although concomitant administration of Carbamazepine and Cope is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant Carbamazepine may result in an increase in plasma Cope levels. A reduced Cope dosage should be used when it is combined with drugs like fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline. The action of hypotensive drugs may be potentiated. Other anticholinergic drug action may also be increased. Administration of adrenaline should generally be avoided due to possibility of reversal of adrenaline effect due to alpha adrenergic blockade by Cope. Concomitant use of Cope with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (such as phenothiazines, antidepressants, propafenone, flecainide and encainide) or those that inhibit this enzyme such as quinidine; require lower doses of either Cope or the other drugs.",

        "information": "Medication should not be stopped abruptly; should be tapered off over 1-2 weeks. If conditions warrant abrupt discontinuation (leukopenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy), monitor patient for psychosis and cholinergic rebound (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse effects (including agranulocytosis, cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and tardive dyskinesia). Significant risk of agranulocytosis, potentially life-threatening. WBC testing should occur weekly for the first 6 months of therapy; thereafter, if acceptable WBC counts are maintained (WBC 3000/mm3, ANC 1500/mm3) then WBC counts can be monitored every other week. WBCs must be monitored weekly for the first 4 weeks after therapy discontinuation. Use with caution in patients receiving other marrow suppressive agents. Eosinophilia has been reported to occur with Cope and may require temporary or permanent interruption of therapy. Cognitive and/or motor impairment (sedation) is common with Cope, resulting in impaired performance of tasks requiring alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). Use with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures, head trauma, brain damage, alcoholism, or concurrent therapy with medications which may lower seizure threshold. Has been associated with benign, self-limiting fever (<100.4°F, usually within first 3 weeks). However, dozapine may also be associated with severe febrile reactions, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Cope's potential for extrapyramidal symptoms appear to be extremely low. May cause anticholinergic effects; should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention, benign prostatic hyperplasia, narrow-angle glaucoma, xerostomia, visual problems, constipation, or history of bowel obstruction. May cause hyperglycemia; in some cases may be extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death. Use with caution in patients with diabetes or other disorders of glucose regulation; monitor for worsening of glucose control. Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease or impairment; hepatitis has been reported as a consequence of therapy. May cause orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia; should be used with caution in patients at risk of hypotension or in patients where transient hypotensive episodes would be poorly tolerated (cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease). Concurrent use of psychotropics and benzodiazepines may increase the risk of severe cardiopulmonary reactions. Myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, and CHF have also been associated with Cope. Fatalities due to myocarditis have been reported; highest risk in the first month of therapy, however, later cases also reported. Myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who present with signs/symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema), chest pain, palpitations, new electrocardiographic abnormalities (arrhythmias, ST-T wave abnormalities), or unexplained fever. Patients with tachycardia during the first month of therapy should be closely monitored for other signs of myocarditis. Discontinue Cope if myocarditis is suspected; do not rechallenge in patients with Cope-related myocarditis. The reported rate of cardiomyopathy in Cope treated patients is similar to that in the general population. The majority of patients were over 50 years of age and were taking Cope for >6 months. Cope should be discontinued in patients with confirmed cardiomyopathy unless benefit clearly outweighs risk. Rare cases of thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and stroke resulting in fatalities, have been associated with Cope.",

Aspiration pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported. Seizures have occurred in a minority of reported cases. Fatal overdoses have been reported with Cope, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 gm. Management of Overdose: Should be established and maintained an airway; should be ensured adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Activated charcoal, which may be used with sorbitol, may be as or more effective than emesis or lavage, and should be considered in treating overdosage. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring is recommended along with general symptomatic and supportive measures. Additional surveillance should be continued for several days because of the risk of delayed effects. Avoid epinephrine and derivatives when treating hypotension, and quinidine and procainamide when treating cardiac arrhythmia. There are no specific antidotes for Cope. Forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. ln managing overdosage, the physician should consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement.",
