        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Analpain overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Analpain concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Analpain. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening. Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.",

There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.",

It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Ancipro are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Ancipro has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Ancipro combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Ancipro to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

        "information": "The therapeutic class of Iron Sucrose is haematinic. Iron Sucrose Injection USP is a brown, sterile, aqueous, complex of Polynuclear Iron (III) Hydroxide in Sucrose for Intravenous use. The drug product contains approximately 30% Sucrose w/v (300 mg/ml) and has a pH of 10.5-11.1. Following intravenous administration, Iron Sucrose Injection is dissociated into Iron and Sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system, and Iron is transferred from the blood to a pool of Iron in the liver and bone marrow. Ferritin, an Iron storage protein, binds and sequesters Iron in a nontoxic form, from which Iron is easily available. Iron binds to plasma transferrin, which carries Iron within the plasma and the extracellular fluid to supply the tissues. The transferrin receptor, located in the cell, and the transferrin-receptor complex is returned to the cell membrane. Transferrin without Iron (apotransferrin) is then released to the plasma. The intracellular Iron becomes (mostly) haemoglobin in circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Transferrin synthesis is increased and ferritin production reduced in Iron deficiency. The converse is true when Iron is plentiful. Its elimination halflife is 6 h, total clearance is 1.2 L/h, non-steady state apparent volume of distribution is 10.0 L and steady state apparent volume of distribution is 7.9 L. In Iron Sucrose, its Iron component appears to distribute mainly in blood and to some extent in extravascular fluid. A significant amount of the administered Iron distributes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and that the bone marrow is an Iron trapping compartment and not a reversible volume distribution. The sucrose component is eliminated mainly through urinary excretion.",

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Anfasil has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Anfasil and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Anfasil 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop. Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

        "information": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Anfasil is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Read moreAmiflox is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Amiflox are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Amiflox has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Amiflox combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Amiflox to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.",

The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.

It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS.

        "information": "The combination of Amlodipine and Benazepril is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. While the mechanism through which Benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, Benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine are not significantly different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine from individual tablet formulations. Following oral administration of this capsule, peak plasma concentrations of Benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of Amlodipine are reached 6-12 hours after administration of this capsule; the extent of absorption is 64%-90%. Over 700 patients received Benazepril/Amlodipine once daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Benazepril/Amlodipine lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Once-daily doses of Benazepril/Amlodipine using Benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and Amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.",

Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Benazepril/Amlodipine in U.S. studies were cough and edema. The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine are cough, headache, dizziness and edema. The incidence of edema was statistically greater in patients treated with Amlodipine monotherapy than in patients treated with the combination. Edema and certain other side effects are associated with Amlodipine monotherapy in a dose-dependent manner, and appear to affect women more than men. The addition of Benazepril resulted in lower incidences as shown in study; the protective effect of Benazepril was independent of race and (within the range of doses tested) of dose. Other rare side effects are angioedema, asthenia, fatigue, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, decreased libido, flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, dermatitis, dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, esophagitis, hypokalemia, pharyngitis etc.",

Clavulanic acid possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus Clavulanic acid in this preparation protects Amoxicillin from degradation by (3-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum to embrace a wide range of microorganisms.",

However, LDL-C reduction was not altered. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were co administered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were co-administered than when either drug was given alone. When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with co- administration of atorvastatin and erythromycin. Co- administration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinylestradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ampol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M 1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M 1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known.

As Anasec is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Anasec 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Anasec 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Anasec and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Anasec is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Anasec and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

        "information": "The therapeutic class of Iron Sucrose is haematinic. Iron Sucrose Injection USP is a brown, sterile, aqueous, complex of Polynuclear Iron (III) Hydroxide in Sucrose for Intravenous use. The drug product contains approximately 30% Sucrose w/v (300 mg/ml) and has a pH of 10.5-11.1. Following intravenous administration, Iron Sucrose Injection is dissociated into Iron and Sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system, and Iron is transferred from the blood to a pool of Iron in the liver and bone marrow. Ferritin, an Iron storage protein, binds and sequesters Iron in a nontoxic form, from which Iron is easily available. Iron binds to plasma transferrin, which carries Iron within the plasma and the extracellular fluid to supply the tissues. The transferrin receptor, located in the cell, and the transferrin-receptor complex is returned to the cell membrane. Transferrin without Iron (apotransferrin) is then released to the plasma. The intracellular Iron becomes (mostly) haemoglobin in circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Transferrin synthesis is increased and ferritin production reduced in Iron deficiency. The converse is true when Iron is plentiful. Its elimination halflife is 6 h, total clearance is 1.2 L/h, non-steady state apparent volume of distribution is 10.0 L and steady state apparent volume of distribution is 7.9 L. In Iron Sucrose, its Iron component appears to distribute mainly in blood and to some extent in extravascular fluid. A significant amount of the administered Iron distributes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and that the bone marrow is an Iron trapping compartment and not a reversible volume distribution. The sucrose component is eliminated mainly through urinary excretion.",

The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.",

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn.

        "information": "The therapeutic class of Iron Sucrose is haematinic. Iron Sucrose Injection USP is a brown, sterile, aqueous, complex of Polynuclear Iron (III) Hydroxide in Sucrose for Intravenous use. The drug product contains approximately 30% Sucrose w/v (300 mg/ml) and has a pH of 10.5-11.1. Following intravenous administration, Iron Sucrose Injection is dissociated into Iron and Sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system, and Iron is transferred from the blood to a pool of Iron in the liver and bone marrow. Ferritin, an Iron storage protein, binds and sequesters Iron in a nontoxic form, from which Iron is easily available. Iron binds to plasma transferrin, which carries Iron within the plasma and the extracellular fluid to supply the tissues. The transferrin receptor, located in the cell, and the transferrin-receptor complex is returned to the cell membrane. Transferrin without Iron (apotransferrin) is then released to the plasma. The intracellular Iron becomes (mostly) haemoglobin in circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Transferrin synthesis is increased and ferritin production reduced in Iron deficiency. The converse is true when Iron is plentiful. Its elimination halflife is 6 h, total clearance is 1.2 L/h, non-steady state apparent volume of distribution is 10.0 L and steady state apparent volume of distribution is 7.9 L. In Iron Sucrose, its Iron component appears to distribute mainly in blood and to some extent in extravascular fluid. A significant amount of the administered Iron distributes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and that the bone marrow is an Iron trapping compartment and not a reversible volume distribution. The sucrose component is eliminated mainly through urinary excretion.",

Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load). Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3’5’-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues.

Activation of α-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow. As the most abundantly expressed in the human nasal mucosa, α 1A - and α 2B -adrenoceptors may play the most important role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal mucosa. Xylometazoline is a more selective agonist at α 2B -adrenoceptors, with affinity at α 1A -, α 2A -, α 2C -, α 1B -, and α 1D -adrenoceptors. Xylometazoline decreases nasal resistance during inspiration and expiration and increases the volume of nasal airflow. Compared to oxymetazoline, another imidazoline nasal decongestant, xylometazoline had a slightly faster onset of action although they had a similar duration of action. In one study, subjects with nasal congestion reported relief of earache and sore throat in addition to nasal decongestion: it is speculated that oxymetazoline mediates this effect by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa that contains the venous sinuses and nasal decongestion allows breathing through the nose, providing relief from sore throat caused by mouth breathing that dries and irritates the throat.",

The bioavailability of these agents may be restored by separating the administration of these agents from Antepsin by two hours. This interaction appears to be non-systemic in origin presumably resulting from these agents being bound by Antepsin in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the potential of Antepsin to alter the absorption of some drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, the separate administration of Antepsin from that of other agents should be considered when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical for concomitantly administered drugs. Antepsin should not be co-administered with citrate preparations. Co-administration citrate preparations with Antepsin may increase the blood concentrations of aluminium. The mechanism may be due to the chelation of aluminium which is assumed to increase its absorption. The administration of Antepsin 1 g and enteral feeds by nasogastric tube should be separated by one hour in patients receiving Antepsin 1 g for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration.

Therefore, alters bile composition from supersaturated to unsaturated. Ursodeoxycholic Acid also promotes the formation of liquid cholesterol crystal complexes which enhance removal of the cholesterol from the gallbladder into the intestine to be expelled. Ursodeoxycholic Acid improves cholestatic liver diseases by- Ursodeoxycholic Acid is completely absorbed in the upper intestine. Time to peak serum concentration varies from 30 to 150 minutes. The rate of absorption ranges from 60-80%. After absorption Ursodeoxycholic Acid enters the portal vein and undergoes extraction from portal blood by liver where it is conjugated with amino acid & that may be either glycine or taurine and then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Small quantities of Ursodeoxycholic Acid appear in the circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The biologic half life of Ursodeoxycholic Acid ranges from 3.5-5.8 days.",

Any delay in administration may result in increased dose requirement and decreased effectiveness. As the clinical signs can vary due to many factors such as type of snake, time of reporting after bite, size of snake, amount of venom injected during bite, seasonal & regional variation in venom composition etc., no accurate dosage can be recommended. However, considering the average quantity of venom injected by snake at the time of bite and degree of envenomation, it is recommended to administer initial dose of 5-10 vials of Snake venom antiserum by slow intravenous infusion either undiluted at a speed of not more than 2 ml per minute or after dilution with Normal /glucose saline at a rate of 5-10 ml/kg body weight over one hour. Children should receive the same dose as adults. Constant monitoring of the vital signs at frequent intervals during initial 1 hour is recommended. Requirement of further dosing depends on extent of reversal of coagulopathy confirmed after 6 hours of Antiserum administration by WBCT in haemotoxic bite or if symptoms persist or worsen or in respiratory failure in neurotoxic bite after 1 hour of Antiserum administration. If the blood is still in coagulable or no signs of reversal of paralysis are seen, a further dose of 5 to 10 vials of Antiserum should be administered by slow IV route only. Administration by IM or locally around the bite wound is not recommended. In the majority of cases of both neurotoxic and haemotoxic bites, total dose of 15-20 vials is adequate unless a proven recurrence of envenomation is established. In such a scenario, further doses can be given as per clinical condition of the patient. Hypersensitivity skin test has no predictability value and hence should not be used.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic.

Levodopa (dopamine precursor) is used as a prodrug to increase dopamine levels since it is able to cross the blood brain barrier whereas dopamine itself cannot. Once levodopa has entered the central nervous system, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. After administration, levodopa is rapidly decarboxylases to dopamine in extra-cerebral as well as cerebral tissues. As a result, most of the levodopa administered is not available to the basal ganglia and the dopamine produced peripherally frequently causes unwanted side effects. It is therefore particularly desirable to inhibit extra-cerebral decarboxylation of levodopa. This can be achieved by simultaneous administration of levodopa-benserazide capsule, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. Levodopa- benserazide capsule is a combination of these two substances in a ratio of 4:1- this ratio having proved optimal in clinical trials and therapeutic use - and is just as effective as large doses of levodopa given alone.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

Insufficient data from clinical studies of megesterol acetate are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.

In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apetiz is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apetiz may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

Effects of estradiol: The loss of the ovarian function, accompanied by a depletion of estrogen and progesterone production, leads to the menopausal syndrome, characterized by vasomotor and organic symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy is indicated to eliminate these complaints. Of all physiological estrogens, E2 is the most potent one with the highest affinity to the estrogen receptor. Estrogen target organs include, in particular, uterus, hypothalamus, pituitary, vagina, breast, bones (osteoclasts). Other effects of estrogens include reduction of insulin and blood glucose concentrations local vasoactive effects mediated by receptors, and receptor-independent effects on vascular smooth muscle. Estrogen receptors have been identified in the heart and coronary arteries. Oral administration of natural estrogens is advantageous in certain cases of hypercholesterolemia in order to maximize beneficial metabolic liver effects on lipids.",

Such hepatic enzyme-inducing properties have been established for hydantoins, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazepine, and rifampicin and are also suspected for oxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate and griseofulvin. The mechanism of this interaction appears to be based on the hepatic enzyme-inducing properties of these drugs. Maximal enzyme induction is generally not seen for 2-3 weeks but may then be sustained for at least 4 weeks after the cessation of drug therapy. In rare cases reduced E2 levels have been observed under the simultaneous use of certain antibiotics (e.g. penicillins and tetracycline). The main metabolites of DRSP are generated without involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. Nevertheless, inhibitors of'CYP3A4, like cimetidine, ketoconazole and others, may inhibit the metabolism of E2.",

The potential for an increased synergistic risk of thrombosis should be considered in women who possess a combination of risk factors or exhibit a greater severity of an individual risk factor. This increased risk may be greater than a simple cumulative risk of the factors. HRT should not be prescribed in case of a negative risk benefit assessment. Venous thromboembolism: Both randomized-controlled and epidemiological studies have suggested an increased relative risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), i.e. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Benefit/Risk should therefore be carefully weighed in consultation with the patient when prescribing HRT to women with a risk factor for VIE. Generally recognized risk factors for VTE include a personal history, a family history (the occurrence of VTE in a direct relative at a relatively early age may indicate genetic disposition) and severe obesity. The risk of VTE also increases with age. There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins in VTE. The risk of VTE may be temporarily increased with prolonged immobilization, major elective or post-traumatic surgery, or major trauma. Depending on the nature of the event and the duration of the immobilization, consideration should be given to a temporary discontinuation of HRT.",

The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.",

        "information": "Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of Angifix. Angifix should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by Angifix may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral Angifix is not known. Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of Angifix tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with Angifix. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with Angifix, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve Angifix-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on Angifix’s antianginal efficacy. Treatment with Angifix may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Antaluk did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Antaluk was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Antaluk approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Antaluk. No dosage adjustment for Antaluk is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Antaluk.",

The activity of Ursodeoxycholic Acid is achieved through a decrease in secretion of cholesterol in bile. Ursodeoxycholic Acid achieves this through a few mechanisms: it reduces cholesterol absorption, suppresses liver cholesterol synthesis and it does not inhibit bile acid synthesis. Therefore, alters bile composition from supersaturated to unsaturated. Ursodeoxycholic Acid also promotes the formation of liquid cholesterol crystal complexes which enhance removal of the cholesterol from the gallbladder into the intestine to be expelled. Ursodeoxycholic Acid improves cholestatic liver diseases by- Ursodeoxycholic Acid is completely absorbed in the upper intestine. Time to peak serum concentration varies from 30 to 150 minutes. The rate of absorption ranges from 60-80%. After absorption Ursodeoxycholic Acid enters the portal vein and undergoes extraction from portal blood by liver where it is conjugated with amino acid & that may be either glycine or taurine and then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Small quantities of Ursodeoxycholic Acid appear in the circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The biologic half life of Ursodeoxycholic Acid ranges from 3.5-5.8 days.",

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

Levodopa (dopamine precursor) is used as a prodrug to increase dopamine levels since it is able to cross the blood brain barrier whereas dopamine itself cannot. Once levodopa has entered the central nervous system, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. After administration, levodopa is rapidly decarboxylases to dopamine in extra-cerebral as well as cerebral tissues. As a result, most of the levodopa administered is not available to the basal ganglia and the dopamine produced peripherally frequently causes unwanted side effects. It is therefore particularly desirable to inhibit extra-cerebral decarboxylation of levodopa. This can be achieved by simultaneous administration of levodopa-benserazide capsule, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. Levodopa- benserazide capsule is a combination of these two substances in a ratio of 4:1- this ratio having proved optimal in clinical trials and therapeutic use - and is just as effective as large doses of levodopa given alone.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

Insufficient data from clinical studies of megesterol acetate are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apemeg is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apemeg may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

Insufficient data from clinical studies of megesterol acetate are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apit is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apit may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",
