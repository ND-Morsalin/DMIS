        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Silpol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour.

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Silpol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Read moreFlatulence, abdominal distention, fullness, gas and windy colic: Simecol is an excellent and effective antiflatulent. It is used for relief of the painful symptoms of excess gas in the digestive tract. Such gas is frequently caused by excessive swallowing of air or by eating foods that disagree. Simecol drop is especially used in infants, acts in the stomach and intestines. Thus Simecol enables freeing and eliminating the gas more easily by belching or passing flatus. Large bowel preparation: Addition of Simecol to a polyethylene glycol bowel preparation produces symptomatic improvement prior to investigation in the management of accidental ingestion of foaming detergents. Treatment of poisoning: Simecol has an anecdotal use as an antifoaming agent in the management of accidental ingestion of foaming detergents.",

The clinical use of Simeticone is based on its antifoaming properties. Its antifoaming action relieves flatulence by dispersing and preventing the formation of mucous surrounded gas pockets in the GI tract. Simeticone acts in the stomach and intestines to change the surface tension of gas bubbles, enabling them to coalesce; thus gas is freed and eliminated more easily by belching or passing flatus. Simeticone aids in the elimination of gas from the GI tract and can be used to reduce postoperative gas pains. Simeticone can also be used prior to gastroscopy to enhance visualization and prior to radiography of the intestine to reduce gas shadows.",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

Iron deficiency anaemias are most often the result of chronic haemorrhage, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy or parasite infestation or malabsorption of iron. A deficiency of Folic acid typically during pregnancy has long been known to cause a megaloblastic anaemia. The vitamin is not storable in the body and the combination of fetal demand during pregnancy and malnutrition can lead to a deficiency, hence anaemia. It has been observed that the rapid production of red blood cells following treatment with iron may deplete body folate if there is inadequate intake; combination of folic acid and ferrous fumerate avoids the complication. Iron and Folic acid are absorbed in the proximal small intestine particularly the duodenum. Ferrous Fumerate & Folic acid supplements replenish iron deficiency. Thereby arresting the anaemia process. Absorbed iron is taken upto the bone marrow's tissues that form blood cells where it is used to synthesize haemoglobin.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Sinapol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Sinapol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Sinapol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Although Sinapride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations. Ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine. Studies in healthy subjects showed that, there were no clinically relevant effects of Sinapride on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, paroxetine or oral contraceptives.",

It reduces calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx and neurotransmission which inhibits neurotransmitter release in presynaptic neuron endings. Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.",

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Sinlair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Sinlair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Sinlair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Sinlair. No dosage adjustment for Sinlair is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Sinlair.",

Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect. Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Sitadus is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if Sitadus is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.",

Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

        "information": "Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by Sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.",

Co-administration of Sergel MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Seridol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Seridol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Seridol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Like racemic ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic action. Like ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Pharmacokinetics: Dexibuprofen is absorbed primarily from the small intestine. After metabolic transformation in the liver (hydroxylation, carboxylation) the pharmacologically inactive metabolites are completely excreted, mainly by the kidneys (90%), but also in the bile. The elimination half-life is 1.8-3.5 hours; the plasma protein binding is about 99%. Maximum plasma levels are reached about 2 hours after oral administration. The administration of dexibuprofen with a meal delays the time to reach maximum concentrations (from 2.1 hours after fasting conditions to 2.8 hours after non-fasting conditions) and decreases the maximum plasma concentrations (from 20.6 to 18.1 mcg/ml, which is of no clinical relevance), but has no effect on the extent of absorption.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest, not related to underlying congenital heart disease, have been reported during anesthesia induction with Sevoflow in pediatric patients with Down syndrome. During induction, closely monitor heart rate and consider incrementally increasing the inspired Sevoflow concentration until a suitable level of anesthesia is achieved. Consider having an anticholinergic and epinephrine available when administering Sevoflow for induction in this patient population. During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of Sevoflow produces dose dependent decreases in blood pressure. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of Sevoflow.

Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest, not related to underlying congenital heart disease, have been reported during anesthesia induction with Sevorane in pediatric patients with Down syndrome. During induction, closely monitor heart rate and consider incrementally increasing the inspired Sevorane concentration until a suitable level of anesthesia is achieved. Consider having an anticholinergic and epinephrine available when administering Sevorane for induction in this patient population. During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of Sevorane produces dose dependent decreases in blood pressure. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of Sevorane. The recovery from general anesthesia should be assessed carefully before a patient is discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit.",

Clavulanic acid gives protection of Cefuroxime from degradation by beta lactamase enzymes and provides a solution for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by beta lactam resistant bacteria.",

After exposure to the drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the cell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. The silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed that, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents bacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial cells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.",

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Silfil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Silfil Cmax and a 210% increase in Silfil AUC. Silfil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Silfil clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Silfil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Silfil Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Silfil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Silfil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Silfil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Silfil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Silfil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Silfil levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Silfil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Silfil AUC and a 55% decrease in Silfil Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Silfil. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Silfil. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Silfil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Silfil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Silfil, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Silfil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Silfil, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Silfil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Silfil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Silfil - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Silfil in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Silfil. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Silfil is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Silfil are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Silfil exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Silfil (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Silfil dosage is recommended.",

        "information": "Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by Sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.",

There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical studies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with Silinor with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg per day for up to 28 days. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Silinor is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if Silinor is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.",

        "information": "A surgical instrument is a medical device used during surgery to perform specific actions, such as cutting, modifying tissue, or providing access for viewing. Over time, a broad spectrum of tools has been developed-some for general surgical use, others tailored to specialized procedures. Classification systems help surgeons understand an instrument's function and appropriate usage. Innovation continues to drive the development of more precise, safer, and more effective instruments for modern surgery. Surgical instruments have evolved alongside advances in medical science and surgical technique. Early tools were often adapted from everyday implements but were later refined for better precision and safety. Two key milestones shaped modern surgical tools: In the early 20th century, the advancement from antiseptic to aseptic surgery led to widespread adoption of sterilizers, sterile gauze, and cotton. Instrument handles transitioned from wood or ivory to metal, enabling effective sterilization. Simpler, one-piece designs improved safety and usability. During World War II, hand surgery emerged as a subspecialty. Many of the tools developed for this purpose are still in use today, often named after their innovators. Individual tools have diverse history development. Below is a brief history of the inventors and tools created for five commonly used surgical tools.",

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

After exposure to the drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the cell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. The silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed that, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents bacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial cells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

For intravenous infusion each vial of Acyclovir IV Injection should be reconstituted and then, wholly or in part according to the dosage required, added to and mixed with at least 50 mL-100 ml infusion solution. A maximum of 250 mg & 500 mg of Acyclovir may be added to 50 ml & 100 ml infusion solution respectively. After addition of Acyclovir IV Injection to an infusion solution the mixture should be shaken to ensure thorough mixing. Acyclovir IV Injection when diluted in accordance with the above schedule will give an Acyclovir concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v. Acyclovir IV Injection is known to be compatible with the following infusion fluids and stable for up to 12 hours at room temperature (below 25°C) when diluted to a concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v Acyclovir. Acyclovir IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion contains no preservative.

Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid.

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by Sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.",

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

        "information": "This tablet combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

        "information": "This tablet combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks.

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin). Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Impairment of atrioventricular conduction may be observed when verapamil and Sevoflurane are administered concomitantly. Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice. The anesthetic requirement for Sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during Sevoflurane anesthesia. Cases of mild, moderate and severe hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis after anesthesia with Sevoflurane have been reported. An exothermic reaction occurs when Sevoflurane is exposed to CO2 absorbents.

Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest, not related to underlying congenital heart disease, have been reported during anesthesia induction with Sevoflurane in pediatric patients with Down syndrome. During induction, closely monitor heart rate and consider incrementally increasing the inspired Sevoflurane concentration until a suitable level of anesthesia is achieved. Consider having an anticholinergic and epinephrine available when administering Sevoflurane for induction in this patient population. During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of Sevoflurane produces dose dependent decreases in blood pressure. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of Sevoflurane.

        "information": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Sifena caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract.

        "information": "This tablet combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

In study, it is found that high serum Vitamin-E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established). Lutein is a carotenoid specially concentrated in macula. Clinical and animal data indicate that this carotenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage. Although mechanism of action is not clear but one large study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein are associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration: a condition where fine visual activity is lost). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzyme systems. Symptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

        "information": "Silagra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Silagra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Silagra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Silagra concentrations when coadministered with Silagra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Silagra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Silagra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Silagra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Silagra Cmax and a 210% increase in Silagra AUC. Silagra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Silagra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Silagra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Silagra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Silagra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Silagra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Silagra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Silagra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Silagra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Silagra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Silagra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Silagra AUC and a 55% decrease in Silagra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Silagra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Silagra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Silagra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Silagra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Silagra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Silagra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Silagra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Silagra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Silagra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Silagra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Silagra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Silagra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Silagra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Silagra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Silagra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Silagra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Silagra dosage is recommended.",

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Silcona has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Silcona and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Silcona 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Silfil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Silfil clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Silfil concentrations when coadministered with Silfil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Silfil was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Silfil systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Silfil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Silfil Cmax and a 210% increase in Silfil AUC. Silfil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Silfil clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Silfil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Silfil Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Silfil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Silfil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Silfil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Silfil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Silfil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Silfil levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Silfil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Silfil AUC and a 55% decrease in Silfil Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Silfil. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Silfil. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Silfil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Silfil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Silfil, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Silfil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Silfil, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Silfil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Silfil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Silfil - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Silfil in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Silfil. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Silfil is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Silfil are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Silfil exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Silfil (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Silfil dosage is recommended.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Siligel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Siligel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Siligel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Siligel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Siligel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Siligel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Siligel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Siligel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Siligel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Siligel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Siligel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Over time, a broad spectrum of tools has been developed-some for general surgical use, others tailored to specialized procedures. Classification systems help surgeons understand an instrument's function and appropriate usage. Innovation continues to drive the development of more precise, safer, and more effective instruments for modern surgery. Surgical instruments have evolved alongside advances in medical science and surgical technique. Early tools were often adapted from everyday implements but were later refined for better precision and safety. Two key milestones shaped modern surgical tools: In the early 20th century, the advancement from antiseptic to aseptic surgery led to widespread adoption of sterilizers, sterile gauze, and cotton. Instrument handles transitioned from wood or ivory to metal, enabling effective sterilization. Simpler, one-piece designs improved safety and usability. During World War II, hand surgery emerged as a subspecialty. Many of the tools developed for this purpose are still in use today, often named after their innovators. Individual tools have diverse history development. Below is a brief history of the inventors and tools created for five commonly used surgical tools.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Silpol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Silpol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Silpol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with cell culture and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.",
