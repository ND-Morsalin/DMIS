        "information": "This is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor.

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium.

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Lumefantrine is a synthetic racemic fluorine mixture belonging to the aryl amino alcohol family like other anti-malarials (e.g. Quinine, mafloquine, halofantrine). Both components act in the food vacuoles of malarial parasites, where they are thought to interfere with the conversion of haem, a toxic intermediate formed during haemoglobin breakdown, to the non-toxic haemozin (a malaria pigment). Lumefantrine is thought to interfere with the polymerization process, while Artemether generates reactive metabolites as a result of interaction between the peroxide bridge and haem iron. Both Artemether and Lumefantrine have a secondary action involving inhibition of nucleic acid - protein synthesis within the malarial parasites. This tablet did not induce resistance. This tablet is active against blood stages of Plasmodium vivax, but it is not active against hypnozoites.

The exact mechanism of action of the drug remains to be elucidated but Sodium Cromoglycate appears to modulate the allergic response to antigen antibody interactions in a way which prevents the subsequent formation or release of toxic or inflammatory mediators. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops appears to act mainly through a local effect on the mucous of the eye. Approximately 0.03% of an ophthalmic dose of Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops is absorbed systemically. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops prevent, release of mediators of type-I allergic reactions, including histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from sensitised mast cells after the antigen antibody union has taken place. The drug does not inhibit the binding of IgE to mast cells nor the interaction between cell bound IgE and the specific antigen; instead Sodium Cromoglycate suppresses the release of substances (e.g. histamine, SRS-A) in response to this reaction. The drug also inhibits Type-III (late allergic, Arthus) reactions.",

Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines. Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae. Doxycycline is active against spirochetes such as Borellia recurrentis, Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue. It is also active against Plasmodium falciparum.",

Muscarinic receptors are widely distributed in ocular tissues, with roles in ocular growth and development, as well as accommodation, recognized. Preclinical studies suggest that Atropine Sulfate acts via binding to the muscarinic receptors located on scleral fibroblasts and possibly in the retina, primarily the M1, M3 and M4 subtypes. This results in changes in the activity of cell signaling proteins and enzymes such as MEK-ERK-MAPK and transglutaminases, and possibly dopamine release, causing scleral remodeling or strengthening, leading to a reduction in axial length and vitreous chamber depth and consequently a suppression of myopia progression.",

It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe reactions to penicillins or to any other beta lactam drugs.Cefadroxil should not be combined with bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol) since an antagonistic effect is possible.Treatment with cefadroxil in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, polymyxin B, colistin or high-dose loop diuretics should be avoided since such combinations can potentiate nephrotoxic effects. Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery. Urinary sugar should be determined enzymatically (e.g. with test strips) during treatment with cefadroxil since reduction tests can furnish falsely elevated values.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Recommended doses of Cavazide, in order of increasing mean effect, are (irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) 150-12.5 mg (one Cavazide -150 tablet), 300-12.5 mg (one Cavazide -300 tablet), and 300-25 mg (two Cavazide -150 tablet). The largest incremental effect will likely be in the transition from monotherapy to 150-12.5 mg (one Cavazide -150 tablet). It takes 2-4 weeks for the blood pressure to stabilize after a change in the dose of Cavazide. The usual dose of Cavazide -150 is one tablet once daily More than two tablets once daily is not recommended. The maximal antihypertensive effect is attained about 2-4 weeks after initiation of therapy. Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: ‘l’he usual regimens of therapy with Cavazide may be followed as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance iss 30 mVmin. Patients with Hepatic impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.",

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",

Neuromuscular blocking agents have no clinically significant effect on consciousness or the pain threshold. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents inhibit neuromuscular transmission by competing with acetylcholine for the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the response of the end plate to acetylcholine.

Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Peripheral blood counts and renal and hepatic function tests should be monitored closely. Blood counts at the beginning of the therapy and weekly to assess haematologic nadir for subsequent dose adjustment are recommended. Neurologic evaluations should also be performed on a regular basis. The drug should be discontinued if abnormal depression of the bone marrow or abnormal renal or hepatic function is seen. Aricarb myelosuppression is closely related to its renal clearance; patients with abnormal kidney function or receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs with nephrotoxic potential are likely to experience more severe and prolonged myelotoxicity. Renal function parameters should therefore be carefully assessed before and during therapy. Aricarb courses should not be repeated more frequently than monthly under normal circumstances. Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and anaemia which are dose dependant and dose-limiting occur after administration of Aricarb. Frequent monitoring of peripheral blood counts is recommended throughout and following the therapy with Aricarb. Aricarb combination therapy with other myelosuppressive compounds must be planned very carefully with respect to dosages and timing in order to minimize addictive effects. Supportive transfusional therapy might be required in patients who suffer severe myelosuppression. Anemia is frequent and cumulative. Transfusional support is often needed during treatment with Aricarb, particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Aricarb can cause nausea and vomiting. Premedication with antiemetics and prolongation of time of Aricarb administration by continuous infusion or over five consecutive days have been reported to be useful in reducing the incidence and intensity of these effects. Renal function impairment may be encountered with Aricarb. Although no clinical evidenceon compounding nephrotoxicity has been accumulated, it is recommended not to combine Aricarb with aminoglycosides or other nephrotoxic compounds. As for other platinum coordination compounds, allergic reactions to Aricarb have been reported. These may occur within five minutes of administration and should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy.",

Therapy should not be repeated until four weeks after the previous Carboplatin course and/or until the neutrophil count is at least 2000 cells/mm3 and the platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3 . Reduction of the initial dosage by 20-25% (i.e, 300-320 mg/m2) is recommended for those patients who present with risk factors such as prior myelosuppressive treatment and low performance status (ECOG-Zubrod 2-4 or Karnofsky below 80). For patients age 65 and over, dosage adjustment, initially or subsequently, may be necessary, dependent on the physical condition of the patient.

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

This cream is composed of Econazole Nitrate, a powerful antifungal and Triamcinolone Acetonide to enforce its antimicrobial effect and the effect of subduing comprehensive inflammations, therefore, it provides remarkable effects on mixed infections of gram-positive and fungus, eczema and recurrent inflammations and shows special effects on bacterial inflammations of skin folds. The range of action of econazole covers all dermatomycoses caused by the following pathogens:- Dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Cladosporium, Yeasts, such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Moulds, Fungi, such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomycosis dermatitidis, and others. As well as Malassezia furfur and Nocardia minutissima. Moreover, it has antibacterial effect on gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Streptococcus pyogens and Staphylococcus aureus. It is also effective against Trichomonus vaginalis, versicolor and balanitis. On the other hand Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic steroid which inhibits not only the early phenomena of the inflammatory process but also the later manifestations. Pharmacological Properties: Econazole Nitrate is only slightly (<0.1%) absorbed from the skin. So no active drug has been detected in the serum. But Triamcinolone Acetonide is well absorbed from sites of local application.",

In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Following intravenous administration of Paclitaxel, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner.

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Although Arokast FT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea.

Lumefantrine is a synthetic racemic fluorine mixture belonging to the aryl amino alcohol family like other anti-malarials (e.g. Quinine, mafloquine, halofantrine). Both components act in the food vacuoles of malarial parasites, where they are thought to interfere with the conversion of haem, a toxic intermediate formed during haemoglobin breakdown, to the non-toxic haemozin (a malaria pigment). Lumefantrine is thought to interfere with the polymerization process, while Artemether generates reactive metabolites as a result of interaction between the peroxide bridge and haem iron. Both Artemether and Lumefantrine have a secondary action involving inhibition of nucleic acid - protein synthesis within the malarial parasites. This tablet did not induce resistance.

It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains",

Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function.

It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance.

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains",

GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates, Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails and various other connective tissues. When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. In humans, about 90 percent of glucosamine, administered as an oral dose of glucosamine sulfate, is absorbed from the digestive tract. Predominantly metabolized by liver & excreted through urine.",

(3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway. Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.",

        "information": "Glucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Asector is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Asector is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Asector does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Asector may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Asector metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Asector 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Asector inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Asector may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Asector. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Asector, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Asector and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines.

It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction. Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next. Its renal clearance is 30 ml/minute and the excretion half-life is approximately nine hours.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.",

As Aspra is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Aspra 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Aspra 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Aspra and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Aspra is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Asta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Asta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Asta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.",

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Atopen overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Atopen concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Atopen. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence. Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",

This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence. Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

Pharmacokinetics: Dexibuprofen is absorbed primarily from the small intestine. After metabolic transformation in the liver (hydroxylation, carboxylation) the pharmacologically inactive metabolites are completely excreted, mainly by the kidneys (90%), but also in the bile. The elimination half-life is 1.8-3.5 hours; the plasma protein binding is about 99%. Maximum plasma levels are reached about 2 hours after oral administration. The administration of dexibuprofen with a meal delays the time to reach maximum concentrations (from 2.1 hours after fasting conditions to 2.8 hours after non-fasting conditions) and decreases the maximum plasma concentrations (from 20.6 to 18.1 mcg/ml, which is of no clinical relevance), but has no effect on the extent of absorption.",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Asmatab approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Asmatab. No dosage adjustment for Asmatab is recommended.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Asozit is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Asozit does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Asozit may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Asozit metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Asozit 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Asozit inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Asozit may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Asozit. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Asozit, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Asozit and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Asta overdose.

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Asta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Atopen overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Atopen concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Atopen. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of ATP overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma ATP concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of ATP. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

It should be used with caution in conditions characterised by tachycardia such as thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, and in cardiac surgery, where it may further accelerate the heart rate. Care is required in patients with acute myocardial infarction as ischaemia and infarction may be made worse. It should be given with care to patients with hypertension. Atropine may cause mental confusion, especially in the elderly. Reduced bronchial secretion caused by systemic administration of atropine may be associated with the formation of mucous plugs.

Persons with Down's syndrome appear to have an increased susceptibility to the actions of atropine. It should be used with caution in conditions characterised by tachycardia such as thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, and in cardiac surgery, where it may further accelerate the heart rate. Care is required in patients with acute myocardial infarction as ischaemia and infarction may be made worse. It should be given with care to patients with hypertension. Atropine may cause mental confusion, especially in the elderly. Reduced bronchial secretion caused by systemic administration of atropine may be associated with the formation of mucous plugs.

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",

Liver Enzymes: It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with ATV Eze and repeated as clinically indicated. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ATV Eze, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart ATV Eze. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ATV Eze. Endocrine Function: Caution should be exercised if ATV Eze is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.",

Similarly concomitant treatment with AU-20 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of AU-20 and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of AU-20 is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments.

These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Vildagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.",

The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia.

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.",

A deficiency of Folic acid typically during pregnancy has long been known to cause a megaloblastic anaemia. The vitamin is not storable in the body and the combination of fetal demand during pregnancy and malnutrition can lead to a deficiency, hence anaemia. It has been observed that the rapid production of red blood cells following treatment with iron may deplete body folate if there is inadequate intake; combination of folic acid and ferrous fumerate avoids the complication. Iron and Folic acid are absorbed in the proximal small intestine particularly the duodenum. Ferrous Fumerate & Folic acid supplements replenish iron deficiency. Thereby arresting the anaemia process.

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use. The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated dose of Articaine HCl and Epinephrine may cause significant increase in blood levels with each repeated dose because of possible accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated patients, elderly patients, acutely ill patients and pediatric patients should be given reduced doses commensurate their age & physical condition. Arocaine-A DC should also be used with caution in patients with heart block. Local anesthetic solutions, such as this dental cartridge contains a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or necrosis may result. Arocaine-A DC should be used with caution in patients during or following the administration of potent general anaesthetic agents, since cardiac arrhythmias may occur under such conditions.

Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery. Urinary sugar should be determined enzymatically (e.g. with test strips) during treatment with cefadroxil since reduction tests can furnish falsely elevated values.",

Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Arovent was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Arovent approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Arovent. No dosage adjustment for Arovent is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Arovent.",

Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic.

        "information": "Glucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains",

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Asector is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Asector is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Asector does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Asector may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Asector metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Asector 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Asector inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Asector may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Asector. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Asector, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Asector and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Asector is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Asector is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Asector does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Asector may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Asector metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Asector 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Asector inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Asector may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Asector. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Asector, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Asector and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

After it is made by the adrenal glands, it travels into cells throughout the body where it is converted into androgens, estrogens and other hormones. These hormones regulate fat and mineral metabolism, endocrine and reproductive function, and energy levels. The amount of each hormone to which DHEA converts to depends on an individual’s biochemistry, age, and sex. DHEA levels peak around age 25 and then decline steadily. DHEA is produced endogenously in the human body by the adrenal gland, liver, and minute amounts in the brain. In men DHEA is also produced in the testes. DHEA is metabolized to androstenedione, which is the major precursor of estrogens and androgens. DHEA changes the ratio of circulating androgens and estrogens. In women supplementation with DHEA seems to significantly increase circulating androgens, but not as much an increase in estrogens in women. In men supplementation significantly increases circulating estrogens while a smaller amount of androgen increase is seen. The androgen and estrogen effects may be responsible for the benefits of DHEA. In the brain, DHEA is concentrated in the limbic regions and may act as an excitatory neuroregulator, which antagonizes GABA transmission. DHEA supplementation may also inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis in platelets, increase IGF-1, increase cGMP, and nitric oxide synthesis, which may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk.",

Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases. The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine.

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Asmont was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Asmont approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Asmont. No dosage adjustment for Asmont is recommended.

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",
