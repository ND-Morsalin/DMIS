It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy. Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss. Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule. The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect. The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",

Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels.

Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects.

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities.",

Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with levodopa alone because carbidopa permits more levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is not recommended for the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions or for the treatment of Huntingdon’s chorea. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet the onset of effect in patients with early morning dyskinesias may be slower than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. The incidence of dyskinesias is slightly higher during treatment with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet (16.5% vs 12.2%) in advanced patients with motor fluctuations. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or with a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions. Care should be exercised in administering Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet to patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered. As with levodopa, Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause involuntary movements and mental disturbances. Patients with a history of severe involuntary movements or psychotic episodes when treated with levodopa alone or levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combination should be observed carefully when Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is substituted. These reactions are thought to be due to increased brain dopamine following administration of levodopa and use of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause recurrence. Dosage reduction may be required. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Impulse control disorders: Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa including Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet.

Both components act in the food vacuoles of malarial parasites, where they are thought to interfere with the conversion of haem, a toxic intermediate formed during haemoglobin breakdown, to the non-toxic haemozin (a malaria pigment). Lumefantrine is thought to interfere with the polymerization process, while Artemether generates reactive metabolites as a result of interaction between the peroxide bridge and haem iron. Both Artemether and Lumefantrine have a secondary action involving inhibition of nucleic acid - protein synthesis within the malarial parasites. This tablet did not induce resistance.

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

Clobazam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal studies have demonstrated reproductive toxicity. Clobazam crosses the placenta. In the post-marketing safety database, limited data on exposed pregnancies are available with clobazam. A large amount of data collected from cohort studies has not demonstrated evidence of the occurrence of malformations following exposure to benzodiazepines during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, in certain epidemiological case-control studies, an increased incidence of cleft lip and palate was observed with benzodiazepines. Cases of reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability have been described after administration of benzodiazepines during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. Administration of clobazam during the late phase of pregnancy or during childbirth can result in the occurrence of neonatal respiratory depression (including respiratory distress and apnea), which may be associated with other disorders such as sedation signs, hypothermia, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties (which may result in poor weight gain) in the newborn (signs and symptoms of the so-called \"floppy infant syndrome\"). Moreover, infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines over longer periods during the later stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at risk of developing a withdrawal syndrome in the postnatal period. Appropriate monitoring of the newborn in the postnatal period is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should be informed of the risks and benefits of the use of Clobazam during pregnancy. If a woman plans a pregnancy or becomes pregnant, carefully evaluate the risks and benefits and whether treatment with Clobazam should be discontinued.

Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from prolonged and/or high dose beta2 agonist therapy. As with use of other inhalation therapy, cough, local irritation and less commonly inhalation induced bronchospasm can occur. As with other beta-mimetics, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness and myalgia/muscle cramps may occur. In rare cases decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase in systolic blood pressure, arrhythmias, particularly after higher doses, may occur. In individual cases psychological alterations have been reported under inhalation therapy with beta-mimetics. The most frequent non-respiratory anticholinergic related adverse events are dryness of mouth and dysphonia. There have been isolated reports of ocular complications (i.e. mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, angle closure glaucoma, and eye pain) when aerosolised ipratropium bromide either alone or in combination with adrenergic beta2 agonist, has escaped into the eyes. Ocular side effects, gastrointestinal motility disturbances and urinary retention may occur in rare cases and are reversible.",

        "information": "This solution for inhalation contains two active bronchodilating substances Salbutamoi Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide. Salbutamoi Sulphate is a beta2-adrenergic agent which acts on airway smooth muscle resulting in relaxation. Salbutamoi relaxes all smooth muscle from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles and protects against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Ipratropium Bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound with anticholinergic properties. In preclinical studies, it appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonising the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increase of intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium Bromide is primarily local and site specific to the lung and non systemic in nature. This provides simultaneous release of Ipratropium Bromide and Salbutamoi allowing synergistic efficacy on the muscarinic and beta2 adrenergic receptors in the airways to cause bronchodilation which is superior to that provided by each single agent and with no potentiation of adverse events.",

This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Comprid XR treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Comprid XR has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Comprid XR is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Comprid XR is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Comprid XR treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Comprid XR has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Comprid XR is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Comprid XR is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Conaz has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Conaz and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Conaz 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

        "information": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Conaz is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended. Driving/Use of machinery: Experience with fuconazole indicates that therapy a unlikely to impair a patient's ability to drive or use machinery.",

It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans. Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans. Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance.

Read moreA glucose meter, also referred to as a \"glucometer\", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L.Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia.",

        "information": ": If you have diabetes, you'll likely need a blood glucose meter to measure and display the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Exercise, food, medications, stress and other factors affect your blood glucose level. Using a blood glucose meter can help you better manage your diabetes by tracking any fluctuations in your blood glucose level. Many types of blood glucose meters are available, from basic models to more-advanced meters with multiple features and options. The cost of blood glucose meters and test strips varies, as does insurance coverage. Study your options before deciding which model to buy.",

        "title": "Choosing the right meter",
        "information": ": When selecting a blood glucose meter, it can help to know the basics of how they work. To use most blood glucose meters, you first insert a test strip into the device. Then with a special needle, you poke a clean fingertip to get a drop of blood. You carefully touch the test strip to the blood and wait for a blood glucose reading to appear on the screen. When used and stored properly, blood glucose meters are generally accurate in how they measure glucose. They differ in the type and number of features they offer. Here are several factors to consider when choosing a blood glucose meter:",
        "items": [
          "Insurance coverage. Check with your insurance provider for coverage details. Some insurance providers limit coverage to specific models or limit the total number of test strips allowed.",
          "Cost. Meters vary in price. Be sure to factor in the cost of the test strips, as these will represent the majority of the cost in the long term.",
          "Ease of use. Some meters are easier to use than others. Are both the meter and test strips comfortable and easy to hold? Can you easily see the numbers on the screen? How easy is it to get blood onto the strips? How much blood is required?",
          "Special features. Ask about the features to see what meets your specific needs. Special features may include large, easy-to-handle buttons and test strips, illuminated screens, and audio, which may be useful for people with impaired vision.",
          "Information storage and retrieval. Consider how the meter stores and retrieves information. Some can track time and date of a test, the result, and trends over time. Some meters offer the ability to share your readings in real time with your healthcare provider with a smartphone app. Or some may offer the option to download your blood glucose readings to a computer, then email the test results to your doctor.",
          "Support. Most meter manufacturers include a toll-free number that you can call for help. Look for a meter that includes clear instructions that demonstrate the correct way to use the meter. Some manufacturers offer users manuals on their websites."
