Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled. This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.",

        "information": "A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures. The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors. Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

Smooth muscle relaxation may improve blood flow to the urinary tract and widen the opening of the bladder neck, resulting in improved voiding.",

Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action. It works by binding to and inhibiting bacterial penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli, it has a strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preferential binding to PBPs 2 and 3. Upon binding to PBPs, ertapenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with the lengthening and strengthening of the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall, thereby inhibiting cell wall synthesis.",

        "information": ": Ertoxa causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment. There have been post marketing reports of acute kidney injury some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Before initiating Ertoxa, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing Ertoxa in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Ertoxa promptly and institute treatment. Ertoxa increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating Ertoxa. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating Ertoxa and periodically thereafter. Use of Ertoxa is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin And Insulin Secretogogues Insulin and insulin secretogogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.

If ketoacidosis is suspected, Ertoxa should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.",

        "information": ": Ertoxa causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment. There have been post marketing reports of acute kidney injury some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Before initiating Ertoxa, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing Ertoxa in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Ertoxa promptly and institute treatment. Ertoxa increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating Ertoxa. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating Ertoxa and periodically thereafter. Use of Ertoxa is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin And Insulin Secretogogues Insulin and insulin secretogogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Ertoxa may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretogogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretogogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Ertoxa.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Escap is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Escap is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Escap does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Escap may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Escap metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Escap 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Escap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Escap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Escap. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Escap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Escap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esigerd is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esigerd is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esigerd does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esigerd may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esigerd metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esigerd 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esigerd inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esigerd may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esigerd. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esigerd, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esigerd and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation. Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. It is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism. Allopurinol is approximately 90% absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours to 4.5 hours. It has a plasma half life of about 1 to 2 hours. Approximately 20% of the ingested Allopurinol is excreted in the faeces.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esmogel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esmogel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esmogel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esmogel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esmogel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esmogel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esmogel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esmogel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esmogel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esmogel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esmogel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esmosec is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esmosec is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esmosec does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esmosec may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esmosec metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esmosec 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esmosec inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esmosec may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esmosec. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esmosec, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esmosec and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esmosec is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esmosec is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esmosec does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esmosec may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esmosec metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esmosec 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esmosec inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esmosec may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esmosec. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esmosec, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esmosec and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esmotac does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esmotac may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esmotac metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esmotac 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esmotac inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esmotac may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esmotac. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esmotac, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esmotac and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Eso MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Eso MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Eso MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Eso MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Eso MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Eso MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Eso MUPS.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoben is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoben is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoben does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoben may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoben metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoben 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoben inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoben may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoben. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoben, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoben and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esocon is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esocon does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esocon may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esocon metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esocon 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esocon inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esocon may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esocon. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esocon, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esocon and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Co-administration of Esocon 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esocon inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esocon may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esocon. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esocon, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esocon and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoflux is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoflux is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoflux does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoflux may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoflux metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoflux 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoflux inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoflux may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoflux. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoflux, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoflux and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogap is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogap is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogap does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogap may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogap metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogap 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogap. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogap is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogap is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogap does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogap may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogap metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogap 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogap. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolok is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolok does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esolok may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolok metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolok 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolok inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolok may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolok. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolok, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolok and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esom-E inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esom-E may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites.

The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomiloc is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomiloc is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomiloc does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomiloc may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomiloc metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomiloc 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomiloc inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomiloc may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomiloc. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomiloc, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomiloc and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomium is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomium is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomium does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomium may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomium metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomium 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomium inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomium may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomium. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomium, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomium and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomo-Fast is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomo-Fast is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomo-Fast does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomo-Fast may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomo-Fast metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomo-Fast 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomo-Fast inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomo-Fast may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomo-Fast. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomo-Fast, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomo-Fast and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esonaaf is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonaaf is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonaaf does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonaaf may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonaaf metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonaaf 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonaaf inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonaaf may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonaaf. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonaaf, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonaaf and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esonix is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonix is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonix does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonix may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonix metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonix 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonix inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonix may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonix. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonix, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonix and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonix does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonix may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonix metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonix 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonix inhibits gastric acid secretion.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esopin is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esopin is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esopin does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esopin may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esopin metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esopin 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esopin inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esopin may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esopin.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esopra is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esopra is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esopra does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esopra may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esopra metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esopra 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esopra inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esopra may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esopra. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esopra, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esopra and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoprex is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoprex is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoprex does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoprex may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoprex metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoprex 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoprex inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoprex may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoprex. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoprex, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoprex and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoprex MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoprex MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoprex MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoprex MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoprex MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoprex MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoprex MUPS.

A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoprol is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoprol does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoprol may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoprol metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoprol 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoprol inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoprol may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoprol. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoprol, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoprol and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoral is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoral is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoral may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoral is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoral is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoral may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoral MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esosic is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esosic does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esosic may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esosic metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esosic 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esosic inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esosic may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esosic. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esosic, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esosic and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotac is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotac is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotac does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotac may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotac metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotac 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotac inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotac may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotac. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotac, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotac and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotac is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotac is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotac does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotac may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotac metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotac 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotac inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotac may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotac. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotac, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotac and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotid is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotid is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotid does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotid may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotid metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotid 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotor is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotor is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotor does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotor may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotor metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotor 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotor inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotor. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotor and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotor is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotor does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotor may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotor metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotor 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotor inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotor. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotor and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Therefore, Esotor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esowell is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esowell is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esowell does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esowell may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esowell metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esowell 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esowell inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esowell may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esowell. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esowell, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esowell and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoz is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoz is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoz does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoz may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoz metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoz 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoz inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoz may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoz. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoz, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoz and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esprazo is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esprazo is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esprazo does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esprazo may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esprazo metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esprazo 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esprazo inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esprazo may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esprazo. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esprazo, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esprazo and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esprazo is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esprazo is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esprazo does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esprazo may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esprazo metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esprazo 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esprazo inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esprazo may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esprazo. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esprazo, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esprazo and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoben is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoben is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoben does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoben may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoben metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoben 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoben inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoben may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoben. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoben, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoben and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esobest is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esobest is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esobest does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esobest may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esobest metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esobest 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esobest inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esobest may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esobest. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esobest, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esobest and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esobest is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esobest is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esobest does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esobest may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esobest metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esobest 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esobest inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esobest may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esobest. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esobest, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esobest and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esobest MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esobest MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esobest MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esobest MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esobest MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esobest MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esobest MUPS.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esocare does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esocare may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esocare metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esocare 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esocare inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esocare may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esocare. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esocare, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esocare and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esocon is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esocon is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esocon does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esocon may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esocon metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esocon 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esocon inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esocon may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esocon. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esocon, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esocon and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esofour is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esofour is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esofour does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esofour may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esofour metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esofour 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esofour inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esofour may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esofour. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esofour, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esofour and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esofour MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esofour MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esofour MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esofour MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esofour MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esofour MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esofour MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esofour MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esofour MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogap is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogap is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogap does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogap may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogap metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogap 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogap. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Therefore, Esogap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogap. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esogel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esogel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esogel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esogel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esogel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esogel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esogel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esogel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esogel. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esogel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esogel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esolin is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolin is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolin does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esolin may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolin metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolin 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolin inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolin may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolin. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolin, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolin and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esolok is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolok is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolok does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esolok may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolok metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolok 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolok inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolok may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolok. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolok, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolok and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esolok is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolok is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolok does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esolok may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolok metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolok 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolok inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolok may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolok. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolok, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolok and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomep is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomep is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomep does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomep may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomep metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomep 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomep inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomep may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomep. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomep, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomep and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomep is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomep is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomep does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomep may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomep metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomep 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomep inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomep may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomep. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomep, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomep and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomo is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomo is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomo does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomo may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomo metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomo 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomo inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomo may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomo. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomo, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomo and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esomo-Fast is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomo-Fast is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomo-Fast does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomo-Fast may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomo-Fast metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomo-Fast 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomo-Fast inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomo-Fast may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomo-Fast. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomo-Fast, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomo-Fast and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomo-Fast does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esomo-Fast may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomo-Fast metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomo-Fast 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomo-Fast inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomo-Fast may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomo-Fast. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esomo-Fast, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esomo-Fast and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonaaf is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonaaf does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonaaf may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonaaf metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonaaf 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonaaf inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonaaf may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonaaf. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonaaf, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonaaf and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonam is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonam does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonam may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonam metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonam 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonam inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonam may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonam. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonam, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonam and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonix is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonix does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonix may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonix metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonix 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonix inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonix may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonix. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonix, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonix and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esonor is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonor is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonor does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esonor may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonor metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonor 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonor inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonor. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonor and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esopra is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esopra is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esopra does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esopra may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esopra metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esopra 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esopra inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esopra may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esopra. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esopra, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esopra and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoprex MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoprex MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoprex MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoprex MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoprex MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoprex MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoprex MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoprex MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoprex MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoprol MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoprol MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoprol MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoprol MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoprol MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoprol MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoprol MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoprol MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoprol MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoprol MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esosav is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esosav is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esosav does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esosav may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esosav metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esosav 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esosav inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esosav may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esosav. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esosav, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esosav and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esosav is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esosav is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esosav does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esosav may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esosav metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esosav 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esosav inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esosav may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esosav. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esosav, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esosav and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esosil is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esosil is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esosil does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esosil may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esosil metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esosil 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esosil inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esosil may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esosil. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esosil, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esosil and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotac does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotac may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotac metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotac 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotac inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotac may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotac.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotid is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotid is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotid does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotid may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotid metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotid 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotid is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotid is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotid does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotid may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotid metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotid 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esotron is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotron is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotron does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esotron may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotron metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotron 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotron inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotron may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotron. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotron, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotron and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esover is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esover is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esover does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esover may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esover metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esover 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esover inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esover may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esover. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esover, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esover and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoxium does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoxium may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoxium metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoxium 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoxium inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoxium may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esoxium is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoxium is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoxium does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esoxium may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoxium metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoxium 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoxium inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoxium may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoxium. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoxium, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoxium and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esozol is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esozol is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esozol does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esozol may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esozol metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esozol 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esozol inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esozol may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esozol. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esozol, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esozol and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Esozyme is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esozyme is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esozyme does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esozyme may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esozyme metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esozyme 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esozyme inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esozyme may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esozyme. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esozyme, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esozyme and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

However, in the preovulatory or anovulatory cycle, estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset menstruation. Eestrogen also affects the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The pharmacologic effects of conjugated estrogens are similar to those of endogenous estrogens. In responsive tissues (female urogenital organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) estrogens enter the cell and are transported into the nucleus.

These include adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. An increased risk of gallbladder disease in women receiving postmenopausal estrogen has been reported. Some studies have suggested a possible increased incidence of breast cancer in those women on estrogen therapy taking higher doses for prolonged periods of time. Women on this therapy should have regular breast examinations and should be instructed in breast self-examination. Doses of Estracon used should not exceed the recommended doses. A complete medical and family history should be obtained prior to the initiation of any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment and periodic physical examinations should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should include a Papanicolaou smear.

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

Zinc supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc also has some antioxidant properties. Zinc is used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder) in children. In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur. B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esru is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esru does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Esru may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esru metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esru 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esru inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esru may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esru. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esru, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esru and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation.

Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks.

Desmopressin demonstrates markedly diminished pressor activity. Desmopressin administered intranasally has an antidiuretic effect about one-tenth that of an equivalent dose administered by injection. Upon binding of desmopressin to V2 receptors in the basolateral membrane of the cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the nephron, adenylyl cyclase is stimulated.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Epa is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Epa is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Epa does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Epa may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Epa metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Epa 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Epa inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Epa may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Epa. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Epa, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Epa and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Epa is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Epa is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Epa does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Epa may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Epa metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Epa 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Epa inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Epa may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Epa. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Epa, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Epa and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled. This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Epizol is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Epizol is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Epizol does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Epizol may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Epizol metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Epizol 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Epizol inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Epizol may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Epizol. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Epizol, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Epizol and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

The occurrence of a platelet count below 50,000/mm 3 or an absolute neutrophil count below 500/mm 3 is an indication to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction manifested by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. Higher rates of anaphylactic- like reactions have been reported in children who received infusions at concentrations higher than those recommended. The role that concentration of infusion (or rate of infusion) plays in the development of anaphylactic-like reactions is uncertain. Treatment is symptomatic. The infusion should be terminated immediately, followed by the administration of presser agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician. For parenteral administration, Eposide should be given only by slow intravenous infusion (usually over a 30 to 60 minute period) since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of rapid intravenous injection In all instances where the use of Eposide is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. If severe reactions occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of Eposide therapy should be carried out with caution, and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity. Patients with low serum albumin may be at an increased risk for Eposide associated toxicities.",

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Eprazol is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Eprazol is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Eprazol does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Eprazol may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Eprazol metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Eprazol 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Eprazol inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Eprazol may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Eprazol. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Eprazol, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Eprazol and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Unlike other plasminogen activators, Streptokinase is not an enzyme and does not directly convert plasminogen to plasmin. Instead, Streptokinase forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen. Formation of this complex induces a conformational change in plasminogen that exposes its active site. This conformationally altered plasminogen then converts additional plasminogen molecules to plasmin. Pharmacokinetics: Plasma Streptokinase concentrations reach a peak at 2 to 3 min after intravenous administration and peak fibrinolytic activity occurs at approximately 30 min depending on the dose. Streptokinase is cleared from the plasma in two phases. The first phase has an average half life of 18 min, and is caused by the presence of antistreptokinase antibody which combines with Streptokinase to produce a complex that is cleared rapidly from the circulation. The second phase is slower, with a half life of approximately 80 min, and reflects the rate at which Streptokinase combines with plasminogen. Hence, the clearance rate will vary according to the availability of plasminogen and the dosage regimen used.",

Less severe allergic phenomena. such as chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, and high fever, have been reported in between 2 and 20% of patients. The immunological basis of allergic reactions to Eptase is not entirely clear. Investigation of patients who have suffered allergic reactions have demonstrated low titers of antiEptase IgG and IgG1. There was no evidence of any other 1gG subclass nor of specific antiEptase IgE. There is also evidence of cell-mediated immunity with at least five antigenic epitopes on the Eptase molecule which are recognized by human CD4+T-cell receptor αβ+T cells. Allergic reactions usually respond well to withdrawal of therapy, intravenous hydrocortisone and antihistamines. Although some authorities recommend the use of prophylactic intravenous hydrocortisone, there is no good evidence that this is of value.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Erazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Erazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Erazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Erazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Erazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Erazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Erazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Erazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Erazole. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Erazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Erazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",
