Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Lucan-R has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Lucan-R and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Lucan-R 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Lucan-R is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Lucan-R has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Lucan-R and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Lucan-R 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop. Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Lucan-R is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

In humans, administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females).

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Lucza has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Lucza and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Lucza 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop.

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Lucza has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Lucza and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Lucza 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop. Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Lucza is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Lukas.",

Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Lumona FT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Lumona FT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Lumona FT. No dosage adjustment for Lumona FT is recommended.

The formulation contains essential antioxidant vitamins, minerals and Lutein. Vitamin-C is highly concentrated in the lens compared to blood. Long term use of Vitamin-C supplement (10+ years) has been associated with reduced risk of cataract. It has important role in harmful free radicals scavenge activity. In study, it is found that high serum Vitamin-E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established). Lutein is a carotenoid specially concentrated in macula. Clinical and animal data indicate that this carotenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage. Although mechanism of action is not clear but one large study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein are associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration: a condition where fine visual activity is lost). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzyme systems. Symptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children. Copper plays an important role in growth, skeletal integrity and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part of numerous metabolic conversions.",

The acute toxicity of Lomefloxacin following systemic and topical ophthalmic application is low. Lomefloxacin interferes with bacterial DNA related processes like initiation, elongation, and termination phases of replication, transcription, DNA repairing, recombination, transposition, supercoiling and relaxation of DNA. The target molecule for quinolones is the A-subunit of bacterial enzyme gyrase (topoisomerase II). The forming of a stable complex between the quinolone and the whole gyrase teramer A2B2 leads to impaired enzyme functions, resulting in a rapid killing of sensitive bacteria. Cross-resistance has only been reported with other quinolones, but not with any other group of antibiotics.

In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur. B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.",

M-Form is excreted by the kidney and regular monitoring of renal function is advised in all diabetics. M-Form therapy should be stopped 2-3 days before surgery and clinical investigations such as intravenous urography and intravenous angiography, and reinstated only after control or renal function has been regained. The use of M-Form is not advised in conditions which may cause dehydration or in patients suffering from serious infections or trauma. Patients receiving continuous M-Form therapy should have an annual estimation of Vitamin B-12 levels because of reports of decreased Vitamin B-12 absorption. During concomitant therapy with a sulphonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored because combined therapy may cause hypoglycaemia. Stabilization of diabetic patients with M-Form and insulin should be carried out in hospital because of the possibility of hypoglycaemia until the correct ratio of the two drugs has been obtained. Reduced renal clearance of M-Form has been reported during cimetidine therapy, so a dose reduction should be considered. As with a number of drugs, an interaction between M-Form and anticoagulants is a possibility and dosage of the latter may need adjustment.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Timolol Maleate is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity.

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related.

The acute toxicity of Lomefloxacin following systemic and topical ophthalmic application is low. Lomefloxacin interferes with bacterial DNA related processes like initiation, elongation, and termination phases of replication, transcription, DNA repairing, recombination, transposition, supercoiling and relaxation of DNA. The target molecule for quinolones is the A-subunit of bacterial enzyme gyrase (topoisomerase II). The forming of a stable complex between the quinolone and the whole gyrase teramer A2B2 leads to impaired enzyme functions, resulting in a rapid killing of sensitive bacteria. Cross-resistance has only been reported with other quinolones, but not with any other group of antibiotics. No clinical studies are available about the efficacy in cases of infections with chlamydia.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

        "information": ": Letrozole is a potent and highly specific nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Letrozole exerts its antitumor effect by depriving estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells of their growth stimulus. In postmenopausal women, estrogens are derived mainly from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which coverts adrenal androgens primarily androstenedione and testosterone-to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in the peripheral tissues and the malignant tissues can be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. In healthy postmenopausal women, single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg letrozole suppress serum oestrone and oestradiol by 75-78% and 78% from baseline respectively. Maximum suppression is achieved in 48-78 hours. In post-menopausal patients, with advanced breast cancer, daily doses of 0.1 to 5mg suppress plasma concentration of oestradiol, oestrone, and oestrone sulphate by 78-95% from baseline in all patients treated. Letrozole had no effect on plasma androgen concentrations (androstenedione and testosterone) among healthy postmenopausal women after single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg indicating that the blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not lead to accumulation of androgenic precursors. Impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis has not been observed.",

Food slightly decreases the rate of absorption, but the extent of absorption remains unchanged. The minor effect of the absorption rate is not considered to be of clinical relevance and therefore letrozole may be taken after, with or before food. Plasma protein binding of letrozole is approximately 60%, mainly to albumin (55%). The concentration of letrozole in erythrocytes is about 80% of that in plasma. Metabolic clearance to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite is the major elimination pathway of letrozole but is relatively slow when compared to hepatic blood flow. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 3A4 and 2A6 were found to be capable of converting letrozole to this metabolite in vitro but their individual contributions to letrozole metabolism in vivo have not been established. The apparent terminal elimination half-life in plasma is about 2 days. After daily administration of 2.5mg of letrozole, steady-state levels are reached within 2 to 6 weeks.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

As Losectil is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments.

As Losectil V is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil V 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil V 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil V and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil V is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losectil V and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losek is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losek and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of beta cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion. In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

As soon as an overdose of glimepiride has been discovered, a physician must be notifed without delay. The patient must immediately take sugar, if possible in the form of glucose unless a physician has already undertaken responsibility for treating the overdose. Careful monitoring is essential until the physician is confdent that the patient is out of danger. It must be remembered that hypoglycaemia may recur after initial recovery. Admission to hospital may sometimes be necessary even as a precautionary measure. In particular, signifcant overdoses and severe reactions with signs such as loss of consciousness or other serious neurological disorders are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment and admission to hospital. If, for example, the patient is unconscious, an intravenous injection of concentrated glucose solution is indicated (for adults starting with 40 ml of 20% solution, for example). Alternatively in adults, administration of glucagon, e.g. in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg i.v., s.c. or i.m., may be considered. In particular when treating hypoglycaemia due to accidental intake of glimepiride in infants and young children, the dose of glucose given must be very carefully adjusted in view of the possibility of producing dangerous hyperglycaemia, and must be controlled by close monitoring of blood glucose. Patients who have ingested life-threatening amounts of glimepiride require detoxifcation (e.g. by gastric lavage and medicinal charcoal). After acute glucose replacement has been completed it is usually necessary to give an intravenous glucose infusion in lower concentration so as to ensure that the hypoglycaemia does not recur. The patient's blood glucose level should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hours.

The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of beta cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion. In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

As soon as an overdose of glimepiride has been discovered, a physician must be notifed without delay. The patient must immediately take sugar, if possible in the form of glucose unless a physician has already undertaken responsibility for treating the overdose. Careful monitoring is essential until the physician is confdent that the patient is out of danger. It must be remembered that hypoglycaemia may recur after initial recovery. Admission to hospital may sometimes be necessary even as a precautionary measure. In particular, signifcant overdoses and severe reactions with signs such as loss of consciousness or other serious neurological disorders are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment and admission to hospital. If, for example, the patient is unconscious, an intravenous injection of concentrated glucose solution is indicated (for adults starting with 40 ml of 20% solution, for example). Alternatively in adults, administration of glucagon, e.g. in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg i.v., s.c. or i.m., may be considered. In particular when treating hypoglycaemia due to accidental intake of glimepiride in infants and young children, the dose of glucose given must be very carefully adjusted in view of the possibility of producing dangerous hyperglycaemia, and must be controlled by close monitoring of blood glucose. Patients who have ingested life-threatening amounts of glimepiride require detoxifcation (e.g. by gastric lavage and medicinal charcoal). After acute glucose replacement has been completed it is usually necessary to give an intravenous glucose infusion in lower concentration so as to ensure that the hypoglycaemia does not recur. The patient's blood glucose level should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hours.

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.",

Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function, danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.",

The use of M-Fort is not advised in conditions which may cause dehydration or in patients suffering from serious infections or trauma. Patients receiving continuous M-Fort therapy should have an annual estimation of Vitamin B-12 levels because of reports of decreased Vitamin B-12 absorption. During concomitant therapy with a sulphonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored because combined therapy may cause hypoglycaemia. Stabilization of diabetic patients with M-Fort and insulin should be carried out in hospital because of the possibility of hypoglycaemia until the correct ratio of the two drugs has been obtained.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that inhibits the binding of ET-1 to both ETA and ETB receptors.

One of the metabolites of macitentan is also pharmacologically active at the ET receptors and is estimated to be about 20% as potent as the parent drug in vitro.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

After administration, Lubiprostone and its metabolites are observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Lucon has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Lucon and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Lucon 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop. Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Lucon is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N 4-Hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP). During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly-made RNA instead of using real cytidine. Molnupiravir can swap between two forms (tautomers), one of which mimics cytidine (C) and the other of which mimics uridine (U). NHC-TP is not recognized as an error by the virus' proofreading exonuclease enzymes, which can replace mutated nucleotides with corrected versions. When the viral RNA polymerase attempts to copy RNA containing molnupiravir, it sometimes interprets it as C and sometimes as U. This causes more mutations in all downstream copies than the virus can survive, an effect called viral error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis.",

It is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RI\\IA replication including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of C0VID-19. Lupravir is a shape-shifter, called a tautomer. It assumes two forms, one which closely resembles uracil and the other cytosine. Because it appears in these two different forms, once it is recopied, the replicating polymerase develops transition mutations, where a U nucleotide is converted to a C and a C to U. Copying RNA that contains Lupravir results in fatal flaws in the sequence, stopping replication, shortening infection, and limiting transmission. The difference between the structure of an authentic nucleotide and Lupravir is apparently too subtle to trigger removal by the exonuclease repair function of the viral polymerase, a function that has bedeviled these of many other nucleoside inhibitors.",

Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors. In patients treated with Finerenone, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1-2 mmHg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter. At a dose 4 times the maximum approved recommended dose, Finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone C max was achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing. Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1.25 to 80 mg (0.06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage).

Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, M-Kast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of M-Kast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of M-Kast. No dosage adjustment for M-Kast is recommended.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of M-Pol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma M-Pol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of M-Pol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",

Magnesium oxide is a mineral supplement used to treat or prevent low levels of magnesium in the blood. It’s essential for human health and is used over 600 cellular reactions throughout the body. In fact, every cell and organ need this mineral to function properly. It contributes to bone health, as well as proper brain, heart and muscle function. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Approximately 24-76% of ingested magnesium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily via passive par cellular absorption in the small intestine. 20% of the magnesium found in human serum is protein bound. Approximately 60-70% of this fraction is bound to albumin while the remainder is bound to globulin proteins. Magnesium has the ability to bind to 3751 human proteins. Magnesium does not appear to be metabolized. The majority of magnesium is excreted renally.",

Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Makmaul Sanagra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Makmaul Sanagra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Makmaul Sanagra concentrations when coadministered with Makmaul Sanagra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Makmaul Sanagra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Makmaul Sanagra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Makmaul Sanagra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Makmaul Sanagra Cmax and a 210% increase in Makmaul Sanagra AUC. Makmaul Sanagra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Makmaul Sanagra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Makmaul Sanagra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Makmaul Sanagra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Makmaul Sanagra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Makmaul Sanagra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Makmaul Sanagra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Makmaul Sanagra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Makmaul Sanagra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Makmaul Sanagra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Makmaul Sanagra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Makmaul Sanagra AUC and a 55% decrease in Makmaul Sanagra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Makmaul Sanagra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Makmaul Sanagra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Makmaul Sanagra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Makmaul Sanagra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers.

Before prescribing Makmaul Sanagra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Makmaul Sanagra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Makmaul Sanagra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Makmaul Sanagra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Makmaul Sanagra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Makmaul Sanagra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Makmaul Sanagra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Makmaul Sanagra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Makmaul Sanagra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Makmaul Sanagra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Makmaul Sanagra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Makmaul Sanagra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Makmaul Sanagra dosage is recommended.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

The extensive tissue penetration of Maprocin combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Maprocin to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Read moreMaprocin DS is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Maprocin DS are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Maprocin DS has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Maprocin DS combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Maprocin DS to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected. Maprocin DS is indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by sensitive bacteria:",

The action of Ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass. The combination of Coral Calcium and Colecalciferol is composed of Calcium Carbonate with small amounts of Magnesium and other Trace minerals. Coral Calcium ensures better absorption than Calcium of other Calcium Carbonate origin due to its chemical structure that is very similar to the composition of human bone Calcium Carbonate.

Human ejaculation is primarily mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. The ejaculatory pathway originates from a spinal reflex centre, mediated by the brain stem, which is influenced initially by a number of nuclei in the brain (medial preoptic and paraventricular nuclei). Dapoxetine is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) occurring approximately 1-2 hours after tablet intake. The absolute bioavailability is 42%. More than 99% of Dapoxetine is bound in-vitro to human serum proteins. The active metabolite Desmethyl dapoxetine (DED) is 98.5% protein bound. Dapoxetine appears to have a rapid distribution with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 162 L. Dapoxetine is extensively metabolized to multiple metabolites primarily through the following biotransformational pathways: N-oxidation, N-demethylation, Naphthyl hydroxylation, Glucuronidation and Sulfation. There was evidence of presystemic first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The metabolites of the Dapoxetine were primarilly eliminated in urine as conjugates. Dapoxetine has a rapid elimitaion and the terminal half life is approximately 19 hours.",

        "information": "Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is a viral enzyme necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. These multifunctional proteins, including NS3, are essential for viral replication. The N-terminal of NS3 protein confers serine protease activity, whileThe C-terminus of NS3 encodes a DExH/D-box RNA helicase which hydyolyzes NTP as an energy source to unwind double-stranded RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction during replication of viral genomic RNA. NS4A is a cofactor for NS3 that directs the localization of NS3 and modulates its enzymatic activities. Glecaprevir disrupts the intracellular processes of the viral life cycle through inhibiting the NS3/4A protease activity of cleaving downstream junctions of HCV polypeptide and proteolytic processing of mature structural protein. NS5A is a phosphoprotein that plays an essential role in replication, assembly and maturation of infectious viral proteins. The basal phosphorylated form of NS5A, which is maintained by C-terminal serine cluster, is key in ensuring its interaction with the viral capsid protein, or the core protein. By blocking this interaction, pibrentasvir inhibits the assembly of proteins and production of mature HCV particles. NS5A also interacts with viral and cellular proteins to form the HCV replicase complex, and supports the RNA replication of HCV",

Clinical evidence suggests that Calcium is useful for the prevention and treatment of Osteoporosis and associated fractures. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention. In this preparation, Calcium Carbonate is sourced from coral origin. This Coral Calcium has a chemical structure which is very similar to the composition of human bone. Coral Calcium is similar to other sources but ensures better absorption. Vitamin D3 aids in the absorption of Calcium from GI tract and helps to maintain Calcium balance in the body.",

Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resins such as cholestyramine or laxatives such as paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D. Calcium carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations. For this reason, tetracycline preparations should be administered at least two hours before, or four to six hours after, oral intake of calcium. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D. Patients should be monitored with regard to electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum calcium levels. If a bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride is used concomitantly, Max Coral DX should be administered at least three hours before the intake of calcium tablet since gastrointestinal absorption may be reduced. Oxalic acid (found in spinach and rhubarb) and phytic acid (found in whole cereals) may inhibit calcium absorption through formation of insoluble calcium salts.

        "information": "The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumors or tumor extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. The high potency and therapeutic margin of ibandronic acid allows for more flexible dosing regimens and intermittent treatment with long drug-free intervals at comparatively low doses. Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity, It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone. Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels, leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass. Daily or intermittent administration of ibandronic acid results in reduced bone resorption as reflected in reduced levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover, increased BMD and a decreased incidence of fractures.",

        "information": "It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Maxbon. Therefore, patients must wait 60 minutes after taking Maxbon before taking other oral medications. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (estrogen). No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma. In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, i.v. ranitidine caused an increase in Maxbon bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal range of the bioavailability of Maxbon, no dosage adjustment is required when Maxbon is administered with H2-antagonists or other drugs which increase gastric pH. In relation to disposition, no drug interactions of clinical significance are considered likely, since Maxbon does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. Furthermore, plasma protein binding is low at therapeutic concentrations and Maxbon is therefore unlikely to displace other drugs. Maxbon is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs. In a one-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16549). the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking Maxbon 2.5 mg daily or 150mg once monthly. Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of Maxbon, 14% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in the patients treated with Maxbon 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with Maxbon 2.5 mg daily.",

Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. Orally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Maxbon is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, in some cases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply with the dosing instructions. Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue Maxbon and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. While no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications. Since NSAIDs and bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant medication with Maxbon. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ.

        "information": "Mirogabalin belongs to the class of gamma amino acids and its derivatives. Mirogabalin selectively binds α 2 δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). It reduces calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx and neurotransmission which inhibits neurotransmitter release in presynaptic neuron endings. Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Maxima is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxima is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxima does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Maxima may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxima metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxima 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxima. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxima, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxima and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxima MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Maxima MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxima MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxima MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxima MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxima MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxima MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form. MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Maxpro is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Maxpro may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.",

        "information": "Medigra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Medigra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Medigra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Medigra concentrations when coadministered with Medigra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Medigra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Medigra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Medigra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Medigra Cmax and a 210% increase in Medigra AUC. Medigra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Medigra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Medigra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Medigra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Medigra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Medigra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Medigra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Medigra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Medigra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Medigra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Medigra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Medigra AUC and a 55% decrease in Medigra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Medigra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Medigra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Medigra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Medigra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Medigra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Medigra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Medigra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Medigra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Medigra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Medigra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Medigra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Medigra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Medigra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Medigra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Medigra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Medigra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Medigra dosage is recommended.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

        "information": "Mirogabalin belongs to the class of gamma amino acids and its derivatives. Mirogabalin selectively binds α 2 δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). It reduces calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx and neurotransmission which inhibits neurotransmitter release in presynaptic neuron endings. Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Maprocin are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Maprocin has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Maprocin combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Maprocin to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

It reduces calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx and neurotransmission which inhibits neurotransmitter release in presynaptic neuron endings. Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

If this blood clot breaks away from the veins where it is formed, it may reach and block the arteries of the lungs, causing a so-called \"Pulmonary embolism.\" Deep venous thrombosis is a rare occurrence. It can develop whether or not you are taking the Pill. It can also happen if you become pregnant. The risk is higher in Pill-users than in non-users, but it is not as high as the risk during pregnancy. Blood clots can also occur very rarely in the blood vessels of the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Extremely rarely blood clots can occur in the liver, gut, kidney or eye. Very occasionally a thrombosis may cause serious permanent disabilities or may even be fatal. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke increases, as you get older. It also increases the more you smoke. When using the Pill you should stop smoking, especially if you are older than about 35 years of age. If you develop high blood pressure while using the Pill, you may be told to stop using it. The risk of having a deep venous thrombosis is temporarily increased as a result of an operation or immobilisation (for example, when you have your leg or legs in plaster or splints). In women who use the Pill, the risk may be yet higher. Tell your doctor you are using the Pill well in advance of any expected hospitalisation or surgery. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking the Pill several weeks before surgery or at the time of immobilisation. Your doctor will also tell you when you can start taking the Pill again after you are back on your feet. If you notice possible signs of a thrombosis, stop taking the Pill and consult your doctor immediately.",

In rare cases benign liver tumours and even more rarely, malignant liver tumours have been reported in users of the Pill. These tumours may lead to internal bleeding.

If this blood clot breaks away from the veins where it is formed, it may reach and block the arteries of the lungs, causing a so-called \"Pulmonary embolism.\" Deep venous thrombosis is a rare occurrence. It can develop whether or not you are taking the Pill. It can also happen if you become pregnant. The risk is higher in Pill-users than in non-users, but it is not as high as the risk during pregnancy. Blood clots can also occur very rarely in the blood vessels of the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Extremely rarely blood clots can occur in the liver, gut, kidney or eye. Very occasionally a thrombosis may cause serious permanent disabilities or may even be fatal. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke increases, as you get older. It also increases the more you smoke. When using the Pill you should stop smoking, especially if you are older than about 35 years of age. If you develop high blood pressure while using the Pill, you may be told to stop using it. The risk of having a deep venous thrombosis is temporarily increased as a result of an operation or immobilisation (for example, when you have your leg or legs in plaster or splints). In women who use the Pill, the risk may be yet higher. Tell your doctor you are using the Pill well in advance of any expected hospitalisation or surgery. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking the Pill several weeks before surgery or at the time of immobilisation. Your doctor will also tell you when you can start taking the Pill again after you are back on your feet. If you notice possible signs of a thrombosis, stop taking the Pill and consult your doctor immediately.",

        "information": "Molnupiravir inhibits viral reproduction by promoting widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase. It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N 4-Hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP). During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly-made RNA instead of using real cytidine. Molnupiravir can swap between two forms (tautomers), one of which mimics cytidine (C) and the other of which mimics uridine (U). NHC-TP is not recognized as an error by the virus' proofreading exonuclease enzymes, which can replace mutated nucleotides with corrected versions. When the viral RNA polymerase attempts to copy RNA containing molnupiravir, it sometimes interprets it as C and sometimes as U. This causes more mutations in all downstream copies than the virus can survive, an effect called viral error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis.",

        "information": "Mavira is a preparation of Mavira. It is an antiviral drug which is orally active and is developed for the treatment of influenza. It is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RI\\IA replication including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of C0VID-19. Mavira is a shape-shifter, called a tautomer. It assumes two forms, one which closely resembles uracil and the other cytosine. Because it appears in these two different forms, once it is recopied, the replicating polymerase develops transition mutations, where a U nucleotide is converted to a C and a C to U. Copying RNA that contains Mavira results in fatal flaws in the sequence, stopping replication, shortening infection, and limiting transmission. The difference between the structure of an authentic nucleotide and Mavira is apparently too subtle to trigger removal by the exonuclease repair function of the viral polymerase, a function that has bedeviled these of many other nucleoside inhibitors.",

Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).

MUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action. A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.",

There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between Maximox and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram.

The lethal effect is related to binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B. Imipenem has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Maxpro is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Maxpro may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

Specifically, Tamsulosin exhibits selectivity for both alpha 1A and alpha 1D receptors over the alpha 1B -adrenoreceptor subtype. These three adrenoreceptor subtypes have a distinct distribution pattern in human tissue. Whereas approximately 70% of the alpha 1 -receptors in human prostate are of the alpha 1A subtype, the human bladder contains predominantly the alpha 1D subtype while blood vessels express predominantly alpha 1B subtype.

It has been observed that compared to normal tissue, the expression of both isoenzymes are increased in BPH tissue. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow.

However, in a population pharmacokinetic study, Dutasteride serum concentrations were on average 1.6 to 1.8 times greater, respectively, in a small number of patients treated concurrently with verapamil or diltiazem (moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein) than in other patients. Long-term combination of Dutasteride with drugs that are potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A4 (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nefazodone, itraconazole, ketoconazole administered orally) may increase serum concentrations of Dutasteride. Further inhibition of 5-alpha reductase at increased Dutasteride exposure, is not likely. However, a reduction of the Dutasteride dosing frequency can be considered if side effects are noted. It should be noted that in the case of enzyme inhibition, the long half-life may be further prolonged and it can take more than 6 months of concurrent therapy before a new steady state is reached.

There was also no indication of a pharmacodynamic interaction in this study. Dutasteride has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or digoxin. This indicates that Dutasteride does not inhibit/induce CYP2C9 or the transporter P-glycoprotein. In vitro interaction studies indicate that Dutasteride does not inhibit the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Tamsulosin: Concomitant administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride with drugs which can reduce blood pressure, including anaesthetic agents, PDE5 inhibitors and other alpha-1 adrenergic blockers could lead to enhanced hypotensive effects. Tamsulosin-Dutasteride should not be used in combination with other alpha-1 adrenergic blockers. Concomitant administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride (0.4 mg) and cimetidine (400 mg every six hours for six days) resulted in a decrease in the clearance (26%) and an increase in the AUC (44%) of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. Caution should be used when Tamsulosin-Dutasteride is used in combination with cimetidine. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between Tamsulosin Hydrochloride and warfarin has not been conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. No interactions have been seen when Tamsulosin Hydrochloride was given concomitantly with either atenolol, enalapril, nifedipine or theophylline. Concomitant furosemide brings about a fall in plasma levels of Tamsulosin, but as levels remain within the normal range posology need not be adjusted. In vitro neither diazepam nor propranolol, trichlormethiazide, chlormadinon, amitryptyline, diclofenac, glibenclamide and simvastatin change the free fraction of Tamsulosin in human plasma. Neither does Tamsulosin change the free fractions of diazepam, propranolol, trichlormethiazide, and chlormadinon. No interactions at the level of hepatic metabolism have been seen during in vitro studies with liver microsomal fractions, involving amitriptyline, salbutamol and glibenclamide. Diclofenac however, may increase the elimination rate of Tamsulosin.",

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is an important component in the detection of prostate cancer. Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination causes a decrease in mean serum PSA levels by approximately 50%, after 6 months of treatment. Patients receiving Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination should have a new PSA baseline established after 6 months of treatment. It is recommended to monitor PSA values regularly thereafter. Any confirmed increase from lowest PSA level while on Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination may signal the presence of prostate cancer or noncompliance to therapy with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination and should be carefully evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. In the interpretation of a PSA value for a patient taking Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination, previous PSA values while on Dutasteride treatment should be sought for comparison. Treatment with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination does not interfere with the use of PSA as a tool to assist in the diagnosis of prostate cancer after a new baseline has been established.

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylurea, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patient with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. Glipizide is a sulfonylurea which appears to lower blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

        "information": "Molnupiravir inhibits viral reproduction by promoting widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase. It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N 4-Hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP). During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly-made RNA instead of using real cytidine. Molnupiravir can swap between two forms (tautomers), one of which mimics cytidine (C) and the other of which mimics uridine (U). NHC-TP is not recognized as an error by the virus' proofreading exonuclease enzymes, which can replace mutated nucleotides with corrected versions. When the viral RNA polymerase attempts to copy RNA containing molnupiravir, it sometimes interprets it as C and sometimes as U. This causes more mutations in all downstream copies than the virus can survive, an effect called viral error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis.",

It is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RI\\IA replication including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of C0VID-19. Mepira is a shape-shifter, called a tautomer. It assumes two forms, one which closely resembles uracil and the other cytosine. Because it appears in these two different forms, once it is recopied, the replicating polymerase develops transition mutations, where a U nucleotide is converted to a C and a C to U. Copying RNA that contains Mepira results in fatal flaws in the sequence, stopping replication, shortening infection, and limiting transmission. The difference between the structure of an authentic nucleotide and Mepira is apparently too subtle to trigger removal by the exonuclease repair function of the viral polymerase, a function that has bedeviled these of many other nucleoside inhibitors.",

Due to the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, the hyper- excitability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons decreases. Mirogabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; median time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5-1.5h. Mirogabalin has a low plasma protein binding of approximately 25%. Mirogabalin has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 64-88L after single or multiple doses. The drug is cleared mainly unchanged (61-72%) via renal excretion by filtration and active secretion, however a slight fraction (13-20%) is metabolized by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. The mean elimination half-life of mirogabalin observed 2-4.9h. 99% of mirogabalin is excreted through the kidneys, only 1% of the dose is excreted through feces.",

In the last two trimesters of pregnancy, requirements increase to about 80 µg/kg per day (5 to 6 mg). Folic acid is an important factor in cell division and without it, division stops.

Mefin is excreted by the kidney and regular monitoring of renal function is advised in all diabetics. Mefin therapy should be stopped 2-3 days before surgery and clinical investigations such as intravenous urography and intravenous angiography, and reinstated only after control or renal function has been regained. The use of Mefin is not advised in conditions which may cause dehydration or in patients suffering from serious infections or trauma. Patients receiving continuous Mefin therapy should have an annual estimation of Vitamin B-12 levels because of reports of decreased Vitamin B-12 absorption. During concomitant therapy with a sulphonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored because combined therapy may cause hypoglycaemia. Stabilization of diabetic patients with Mefin and insulin should be carried out in hospital because of the possibility of hypoglycaemia until the correct ratio of the two drugs has been obtained.

The use of Meforin is not advised in conditions which may cause dehydration or in patients suffering from serious infections or trauma. Patients receiving continuous Meforin therapy should have an annual estimation of Vitamin B-12 levels because of reports of decreased Vitamin B-12 absorption. During concomitant therapy with a sulphonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored because combined therapy may cause hypoglycaemia.

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

The use of Meglu ER is not advised in conditions which may cause dehydration or in patients suffering from serious infections or trauma. Patients receiving continuous Meglu ER therapy should have an annual estimation of Vitamin B-12 levels because of reports of decreased Vitamin B-12 absorption. During concomitant therapy with a sulphonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored because combined therapy may cause hypoglycaemia. Stabilization of diabetic patients with Meglu ER and insulin should be carried out in hospital because of the possibility of hypoglycaemia until the correct ratio of the two drugs has been obtained.

Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha1, alpha2, beta adrenergic, dopamine (D2), 5-HT1, 5 HT2 and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.",

Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Melpred can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Melpred in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Melpred usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose.

Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Melpred should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Melpred and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Melpred can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Melpred in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Melpred usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Melpred not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.",

Read moreEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

        "information": "Mepal is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Mepal is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Mepal does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Mepal may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Mepal metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Mepal 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Mepal inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Mepal may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Mepal. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Mepal, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Mepal and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",

The intravenous injection of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection. Its anti-inflammatory potency is greater than prednisolone in the ratio of 5 to 4. It has only minimal mineralocorticoid properties and has less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. It influences carbohydrate, protein, fat and purine metabolism, electrolyte and water balance, and the functional capacities of the cardiovascular system, the kidney, the skeletal muscle, nervous system and other organs and tissues.

The desired dose may be administered intravenously over a period of several minutes. When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection, USP is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours. In general, high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient’s condition has stabilized usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. Although adverse effects associated with high dose short-term corticoid therapy are uncommon, peptic ulceration may occur. Prophylactic antacid therapy may be indicated. In other indications, the initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of Methylprednisolone depending on the clinical problem being treated. The larger doses may be required for short-term management of severe, acute conditions. The initial dose usually should be given intravenously over a period of several minutes. Subsequent doses may be given intravenously or intramuscularly at intervals dictated by the patient’s response and clinical condition. Corticoid therapy is an adjunct to, and not a replacement for conventional therapy. Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight, and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia. In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease being treated. The initial dose is 0.11-1.6 mg/day in three or four divided doses. Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size but it should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses is 160 mg daily for 3 days. Methylprednisolone powder for injection/infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over at least 30 minutes.",

It does not interact with the food components and other medications and so there is no decrease in bioavailability of Iron Polymaltose Complex. This makes sure that with the consumption of this complex, iron gets utilized at a faster rate in the haemoglobin synthesis. Folic acid prevents neural tube defects. Zinc is essential for many metabolic processes, blood formation, wound healing and for immune system. Thiamine is essential for the functioning of the nervous and digestive systems.

Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

Magnesium oxide is a mineral supplement used to treat or prevent low levels of magnesium in the blood. It’s essential for human health and is used over 600 cellular reactions throughout the body. In fact, every cell and organ need this mineral to function properly. It contributes to bone health, as well as proper brain, heart and muscle function. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Approximately 24-76% of ingested magnesium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily via passive par cellular absorption in the small intestine. 20% of the magnesium found in human serum is protein bound. Approximately 60-70% of this fraction is bound to albumin while the remainder is bound to globulin proteins. Magnesium has the ability to bind to 3751 human proteins. Magnesium does not appear to be metabolized. The majority of magnesium is excreted renally.",
