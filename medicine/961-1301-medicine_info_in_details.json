Lapatinib inhibits ErbB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. An additive effect was demonstrated in an in vitro study when Lapatinib and 5-FU (the active metabolite of Capecitabine) were used in combination in the 4 tumor cell lines tested. The growth inhibitory effects of Lapatinib were evaluated in Trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in Trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents. Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells (with ER [Estrogen Receptor] and/or PgR [Progesterone Receptor]) that coexpress the HER2 tend to be resistant to established endocrine therapies. Similarly, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells that initially lack EGFR or HER2 upregulate these receptor proteins as the tumor becomes resistant to endocrine therapy.",

There were no significant differences among the three methods in average FiO2 a/A PO2 or MAP at 72 hours of age, or in the incidence of pulmonary air leaks, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, patent ductus arteriosus, or mortality at 72 hours of age.",
          "Method B keeping the infant on the ventilator is considered the delivery method of choice as it was associated with less clinical deterioration (expressed as falls in heart rate and in oxygen saturation) during and immediately following treatment. Method B was associated with a greater degree of Phospholipid reflux than the other methods. This reflux was not associated with any clinical consequence.",
          "Method C: Phospholipids can be administered by inserting the 5 French catheter through the endotracheal tube while the endotracheal tube is briefly disconnected from the ventilator. The half doses were administered in the two positions described as for Method B. The procedure for dosing is similar to Method A, the only difference being the use of two half doses instead of four quarter doses. With the infant supine, the head and body of the infant were turned approximately 45° to the right. The infant is removed from the ventilator and the primed catheter inserted into the endotracheal tube. The first half of the Phospholipids is then delivered and the catheter withdrawn. The infant is then returned to the ventilator for at least 30 seconds of mechanical ventilation. The head and body of the infant is turned approximately 45° to the left. The second half dose of Phospholipids is delivered in the same manner as the first. The catheter is withdrawn and the infant returned to mechanical ventilation."

It acts on the pre-synaptic membrane, enhancing the release of dopamine and inhibiting its reuptake. Post-synaptically, Amantadine acts directly on the dopamine receptor, and up regulates D2 receptors. This may be due to Amantadine-induced hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. It has antimuscarinic properties. Amantadine also has antiglutamatergic properties, via non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, potent, competitive, non-subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists reduce the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. NMDA receptor sensitization may be a key event in the genesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. It also has immunomodulatory properties. It restores the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is defective in Parkinson’s disease patients. The mechanism by which Amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. Amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.",

Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed. There is no specific antidote for an overdose of Amantril. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by Amantril. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of Amantril. Since the excretion rate of Amantril increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered. The patient should be observed for the possible development of arrhythmias and hypotension; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic and antihypotensive therapy should be given. Electrocardiographic monitoring may be required after ingestion, since malignant tachyarrhythmias can appear after overdose.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. This cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Lactation: Corticosteroids, when systemically administered, the drug appear in human milk. It is not known whether topical application of this cream could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities of Fluocinolone Acetonide, Hydroquinone or Tretinoin in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this cream is administered to nursing women.",

Local irritation, such as skin reddening, peeling, mild burning sensation, dryness and pruritus may be expected at the site of application. Transient skin reddening or mild burning sensation does not preclude treatment. If a reaction suggests hypersensitivity or chemical irritation, the use of the medication should be discontinued. This cream also contains the corticosteroid Fluocinolone Acetonide. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroid while on treatment. If HPA axis suppression is noted, the use of this cream should be discontinued. Recovery of HPA axis function generally occurs upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

This should be evaluated according to clinical status of the patient, in particular in relation to pathologies of the cardiovascular, urinary or hepatobiliary system. In particular contrast media designed for cardioangiography should be used in hospitals or clinics equipped and staffed for intensive care in emergencies. For other diagnostic procedures requiring the use of iodinised contrast media, in the public or institutions where such procedures take place, resuscitation equipment and therapeutic measures should be immediately available. When examining small children or babies, do not limit fluid intake before administering a hypertonic contrast solution. Also correct any existing water and electrolyte imbalance. X-ray examination of woman should also, if possible be conducted during the pre-ovulation phage of menstrual cycle.

        "information": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed.

Read moreAmiflox DS is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Amiflox DS are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Amiflox DS has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Amiflox DS combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Amiflox DS to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours.

It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.",

Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H 1 ) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS.

Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of Angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of Angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for Angiotensin II synthesis. Amlodipine and Valsartan have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both Amlodipine and Valsartan lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but calcium influx blockade and reduction of Angiotensin II vasoconstriction are complementary mechanisms.",

Amoxicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive & Gram-negative microorganisms but it is susceptible to degradation by (3-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not include microorganisms, which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus Clavulanic acid in this preparation protects Amoxicillin from degradation by (3-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum to embrace a wide range of microorganisms.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ampol XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ampol XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ampol XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

Tranexamic acid is a substance endowed with a strong antifibrinolytic action and both in vivo and in vitro it has proved to be 10 times more active than conventional hemostatics, depending on the test. The antihemorrhagic action of tranexamic acid is essentially due to an inhibition of the plasminogen activation of both exogenous activators like streptokinase and endogenous ones like urokinase and the plasminogen tissue activator. This fact is particularly important for the clinical use of Tranexamic Acid, because it ensures an antihemorrhagic activity with an antifibrinolytic mechanism under a variety of conditions. The acute toxicity of Tranexamic Acid is extremely low and chronic toxicity almost non-existent. Tranexamic Acid is well absorbed by oral route and the effect is already seen 15-30 minutes after administration. It is excreted mainly by renal route but more slowly than conventional hemostatics. These features make the Tranexamic Acid effect more lasting than those conventional hemostatics. Considerably lower single doses of Tranexamic Acid can thus be administered at greater intervals without the drug plasma levels dropping to inefficient levels of antifibrinolytic activity between one dose and the other. Tranexamic Acid at therapeutic doses does not interfere with clotting processes and even a prolonged administration has not been seen to be accompanied by any tendency to thrombophilia.",

It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Ancipro are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Ancipro has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Ancipro combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Ancipro to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours.

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.",

The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.",

These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Amikast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Amikast. No dosage adjustment for Amikast is recommended.

These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.

Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H 1 ) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use.

Amisulpride binds selectively to the human dopaminergic D2 and D3 receptor without any affinity for all, D4 and D5 receptor subtypes. Unlike classical and atypical neuroleptics amisulpride displays low affinity for serotonin, a-adrenergic, histamine receptor subtypes, muscarinic receptors and sigma sites. In addition, it does not induce catalepsy and it does not produce D2 hypersensitivity after repeated treatment. Moreover, it preferentially blocks pre-synaptic D2/D3 dopamine receptors, producing dopamine release responsible for its disinhibitory effects.",

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.",

        "information": "The combination of Amlodipine and Benazepril is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. While the mechanism through which Benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, Benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine are not significantly different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine from individual tablet formulations. Following oral administration of this capsule, peak plasma concentrations of Benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of Amlodipine are reached 6-12 hours after administration of this capsule; the extent of absorption is 64%-90%. Over 700 patients received Benazepril/Amlodipine once daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Benazepril/Amlodipine lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Once-daily doses of Benazepril/Amlodipine using Benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and Amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.",

Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Benazepril/Amlodipine in U.S. studies were cough and edema. The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine are cough, headache, dizziness and edema. The incidence of edema was statistically greater in patients treated with Amlodipine monotherapy than in patients treated with the combination. Edema and certain other side effects are associated with Amlodipine monotherapy in a dose-dependent manner, and appear to affect women more than men. The addition of Benazepril resulted in lower incidences as shown in study; the protective effect of Benazepril was independent of race and (within the range of doses tested) of dose. Other rare side effects are angioedema, asthenia, fatigue, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, decreased libido, flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, dermatitis, dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, esophagitis, hypokalemia, pharyngitis etc.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related.

It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.",

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.

The phenylpropionate ester gives the preparation a duration of action of about one week after injection. Nandrolone is chemically related to the male hormone. Compared to testosterone, it has an enhanced anabolic and a reduced androgenic activity. This has been demonstrated in animal bioassays and explained by receptor binding studies. The low androgenicity of nandrolone is confirmed in clinical use. In the human, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has a nitrogen saving action. This effect on protein metabolism has been established by metabolic studies and is utilized therapeutically in conditions where a protein deficiency exists such as during chronic debilitating diseases and after major surgery and severe trauma. In these conditions, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate serves as a supportive adjunct to specific therapies and dietary measures. In women with disseminated mammary carcinoma, in selected cases Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been reported to produce objective regressions for many months. Furthermore, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been shown to produce relief of bone pain in patients with osteoporosis. The similarly acting nandrolone ester, nandrolone decanoate, has been shown to increase bone mineral content in these patients. Androgenic effects (e.g. virilisation) are relatively uncommon at the recommended dosages.

Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Analpain overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Analpain concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Analpain. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Analpain overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Analpain concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Analpain. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

As Anasec is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Anasec 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Anasec 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Anasec and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Anasec is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Anasec and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.",

        "information": "This is a preparation of tranexamic acid (trans-4 aminomethyl-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid). Tranexamic acid is a substance endowed with a strong antifibrinolytic action and both in vivo and in vitro it has proved to be 10 times more active than conventional hemostatics, depending on the test. The antihemorrhagic action of tranexamic acid is essentially due to an inhibition of the plasminogen activation of both exogenous activators like streptokinase and endogenous ones like urokinase and the plasminogen tissue activator. This fact is particularly important for the clinical use of Tranexamic Acid, because it ensures an antihemorrhagic activity with an antifibrinolytic mechanism under a variety of conditions. The acute toxicity of Tranexamic Acid is extremely low and chronic toxicity almost non-existent. Tranexamic Acid is well absorbed by oral route and the effect is already seen 15-30 minutes after administration. It is excreted mainly by renal route but more slowly than conventional hemostatics. These features make the Tranexamic Acid effect more lasting than those conventional hemostatics. Considerably lower single doses of Tranexamic Acid can thus be administered at greater intervals without the drug plasma levels dropping to inefficient levels of antifibrinolytic activity between one dose and the other. Tranexamic Acid at therapeutic doses does not interfere with clotting processes and even a prolonged administration has not been seen to be accompanied by any tendency to thrombophilia.",

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Anfasil has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Anfasil and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Anfasil 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Anfasil is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load). Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3’5’-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates thecontractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilation.",

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Anfasil has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Anfasil and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Anfasil 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Anfasil is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load). Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3’5’-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates thecontractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilation.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.",

Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load). Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3’5’-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates thecontractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilation.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Levodopa (dopamine precursor) is used as a prodrug to increase dopamine levels since it is able to cross the blood brain barrier whereas dopamine itself cannot. Once levodopa has entered the central nervous system, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. After administration, levodopa is rapidly decarboxylases to dopamine in extra-cerebral as well as cerebral tissues. As a result, most of the levodopa administered is not available to the basal ganglia and the dopamine produced peripherally frequently causes unwanted side effects. It is therefore particularly desirable to inhibit extra-cerebral decarboxylation of levodopa. This can be achieved by simultaneous administration of levodopa-benserazide capsule, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. Levodopa- benserazide capsule is a combination of these two substances in a ratio of 4:1- this ratio having proved optimal in clinical trials and therapeutic use - and is just as effective as large doses of levodopa given alone.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

Insufficient data from clinical studies of megesterol acetate are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apit is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apit may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions. Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.

Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur.

The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria.

It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",

Activation of α-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow. As the most abundantly expressed in the human nasal mucosa, α 1A - and α 2B -adrenoceptors may play the most important role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal mucosa. Xylometazoline is a more selective agonist at α 2B -adrenoceptors, with affinity at α 1A -, α 2A -, α 2C -, α 1B -, and α 1D -adrenoceptors. Xylometazoline decreases nasal resistance during inspiration and expiration and increases the volume of nasal airflow. Compared to oxymetazoline, another imidazoline nasal decongestant, xylometazoline had a slightly faster onset of action although they had a similar duration of action. In one study, subjects with nasal congestion reported relief of earache and sore throat in addition to nasal decongestion: it is speculated that oxymetazoline mediates this effect by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa that contains the venous sinuses and nasal decongestion allows breathing through the nose, providing relief from sore throat caused by mouth breathing that dries and irritates the throat.",

The drug is often active against penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and against strains of those organisms that are resistant to other Tetracyclines. Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines. Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae. Doxycycline is active against spirochetes such as Borellia recurrentis, Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue. It is also active against Plasmodium falciparum.",

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apegestrol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apegestrol may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.",

It is this effect which forms the basis for use of Apit in patients with anorexia, cachexia or weight loss. Weight gain is associated with an increase in fat and body cell mass. Untoward reactions that have been reported to occur in patients receiving Apit include nausea, vomiting, edema and breakthrough uterine bleeding and occur in approximately 1% to 2% of patients. Gynecomastia and loss of hearing have also been reported. Dyspnea, heart failure, hypertension, hot flashes, mood changes, Cushingoid facies, tumor flare (with or without hypercalcemia), hyperglycemia, alopecia, carpal tunnel syndrome and rash have also occurred. Thromboembolic phenomenon including thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism (in some cases fatal) have also been reported.",

Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. Insufficient data from clinical studies of megesterol acetate are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Apit is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Apit may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken during treatment with Apit, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",

The second form of renal toxicity often associated with NSAIDs is seen in patients with conditions leading to a reduction in renal blood flow or blood volume, where renal prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal perfusion in these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state",

Activation of the trigeminal ganglion triggers the stimulation of trigeminal afferents that project to the spinal cord and synapse on various pain-sensing intra- and extracranial structures, such as the dura mater. Pain signals are then further transmitted via second-order ascending neurons to the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, and from there to several cortical regions (e.g. auditory, visual, motor cortices). The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The α-isoform of CGRP, expressed in primary sensory neurons, is a potent vasodilator and has been implicated in migraine pathogenesis - CGRP levels are acutely elevated during migraine attacks, return to normal following treatment with triptan medications, and intravenous infusions of CGRP have been shown to trigger migraine-like headaches in migraine patients. In addition to its vasodilatory properties, CGRP appears to be a pronociceptive factor that modulates neuronal excitability to facilitate pain responses. Rimegepant is an antagonist of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor- it competes with CGRP for occupancy at these receptors, preventing the actions of CGRP and its ability to amplify and perpetuate migraine headache pain, ultimately terminating the headache.",

The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:",

It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H 1 ) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.",

However, LDL-C reduction was not altered. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were co administered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were co-administered than when either drug was given alone. When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with co- administration of atorvastatin and erythromycin.

Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for Angiotensin II synthesis. Amlodipine and Valsartan have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure.
