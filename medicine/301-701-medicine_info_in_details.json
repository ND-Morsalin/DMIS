        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Use caution when administering Aceta in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs.

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",

Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia.

The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA.

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: back pain, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, or coma.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One overdose.

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin). Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",

It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace Power overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace Power concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace Power. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

For intravenous infusion each vial of Acyclovir IV Injection should be reconstituted and then, wholly or in part according to the dosage required, added to and mixed with at least 50 mL-100 ml infusion solution. A maximum of 250 mg & 500 mg of Acyclovir may be added to 50 ml & 100 ml infusion solution respectively. After addition of Acyclovir IV Injection to an infusion solution the mixture should be shaken to ensure thorough mixing. Acyclovir IV Injection when diluted in accordance with the above schedule will give an Acyclovir concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v. Acyclovir IV Injection is known to be compatible with the following infusion fluids and stable for up to 12 hours at room temperature (below 25°C) when diluted to a concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v Acyclovir.

This viral enzyme converts Acyclovir into Acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta-PD overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta-PD concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta-PD. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours.

Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",

The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.",

Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound.

Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",

Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",

        "information": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.",

        "information": "Activa metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Activa clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Activa clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Activa concentrations when coadministered with Activa (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Activa was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Activa systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Activa Cmax and a 210% increase in Activa AUC. Activa had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Activa clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Activa Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Activa plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Activa were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Activa was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Activa had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Activa has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Activa levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Activa at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Activa AUC and a 55% decrease in Activa Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Activa. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Activa. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Activa pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Activa, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",
        "items": [

          "In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.",

Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours.

Patients should be advised to check their body weight on a regular basis. In the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning weight decrease, the intake of Adair should be stopped and body weight should be further followed-up. Special clinical conditions: Due to lack of relevant experience, treatment with Adair should not be initiated or existing treatment with Adair should be stopped in patients with severe immunological diseases (e.g. HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), severe acute infectious diseases, cancers (except basal cell carcinoma), or patients being treated with immunosuppressive medicinal products (i.e.: methotrexate, azathioprine, infliximab, etanercept, or oral corticosteroids to be taken long-term; except short-term systemic corticosteroids). Experience in patients with latent infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, herpes viral infection and herpes zoster is limited. Patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA grades 3 and 4) have not been studied and therefore treatment of these patients is not recommended. Psychiatric disorders: Adair is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, nervousness and depression. Rare instances of suicidal ideation and behaviour, including completed suicide, have been observed in patients with or without history of depression, usually within the first weeks of treatment. The risks and benefits of starting or continuing treatment with Adair should be carefully assessed if patients report previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant treatment with other medicinal products likely to cause psychiatric events is intended. Adair is not recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

        "information": "Adegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Adegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Adegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Adegra concentrations when coadministered with Adegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Adegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Adegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Adegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Adegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Adegra AUC. Adegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Adegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Adegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Adegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Adegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Adegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Adegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Adegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Adegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Adegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Adegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Adegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Adegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Adegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Adegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Adegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Adegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Adegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Adegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Adegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Adegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Adegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Adegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Adegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Adegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Adegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Adegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Adegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Adegra dosage is recommended.",

As undigested triglycerides can not be absorbed, a caloric deficit arises which has a positive effect on weight control. Systemic absorption of orlistat is therefore not needed for the activity.

Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.",

Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery.

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Adol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Adol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Adol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Read moreAdjunctive use in the management of cardiac arrest. It is used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Intracardiac puncture and intramyocardial injection of Adrin may be effective when external cardiac compression and attempts to restore the circulation by electrical defibrillation or use of a pacemaker fail. Adrin is a drug that leads to increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased air entry, increased blood glucose, stimulates cardiac activity and reduces allergic reactions by reducing inflammatory response caused by histamine. Due to these properties, it is used for the treatment of allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Adrin is the favored treatment for anaphylactic shock and should be administered immediately if a person begins exhibiting severe allergic reactions. Adrin is also used in life threatening asthma when failing ventilation and continued deterioration despite nebulizer therapy.",

        "information": "The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. It acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by (1) direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation. When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors.",

Adrin is rapid in onset and with short duration. After IV infusion the half-life is approximately 5-10 minutes. It is rapidly distributed to the heart, spleen, several glandular tissues and adrenergic nerves. Adrin is rapidly metabolised in the liver and tissues by oxidative de-amination and O- methylation followed by reduction or by conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulphate.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.",

        "information": "Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.",

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

        "information": "Activa metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Activa clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Activa clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Activa concentrations when coadministered with Activa (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Activa was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Activa systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Activa Cmax and a 210% increase in Activa AUC. Activa had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Activa clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Activa Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Activa plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Activa were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Activa was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Activa had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Activa has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Activa levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Activa at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Activa AUC and a 55% decrease in Activa Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Activa. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Activa. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Activa pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Activa, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers.

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",

It is particularly important to make serum and urine electrolyte determinations when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalaemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Hypokalaemia can sensitise or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g. increased ventricular irritability). Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Hypokalaemia may be avoided or treated in the adult by concurrent use of amiloride hydrochloride, a potassium conserving agent. It may also be avoided by giving potassium chloride or foods with a high potassium content. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is usually mild and asymptomatic. Dilutional hyponatraemia may occur in oedematous patients in hot weather; and, except in rare instances when hyponatraemia is life-threatening, appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt. Thiazides may decrease serum protein bound iodine levels without signs of thyroid disturbances. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, and may also cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. When creatinine clearance falls below 30ml/min, thiazide diuretics become ineffective. Uraemia may be precipitated or increased by chlorothiazide. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If increasing uraemia and oliguria occur during treatment of renal disease, Acuren should be discontinued. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Hyperuricaemia may occur, or gout may be precipitated, in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Thaizide therapy may impair glucose tolerance.

It is particularly important to make serum and urine electrolyte determinations when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalaemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Hypokalaemia can sensitise or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g. increased ventricular irritability). Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Hypokalaemia may be avoided or treated in the adult by concurrent use of amiloride hydrochloride, a potassium conserving agent. It may also be avoided by giving potassium chloride or foods with a high potassium content. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is usually mild and asymptomatic. Dilutional hyponatraemia may occur in oedematous patients in hot weather; and, except in rare instances when hyponatraemia is life-threatening, appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt. Thiazides may decrease serum protein bound iodine levels without signs of thyroid disturbances. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, and may also cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. When creatinine clearance falls below 30ml/min, thiazide diuretics become ineffective. Uraemia may be precipitated or increased by chlorothiazide. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If increasing uraemia and oliguria occur during treatment of renal disease, Acuren should be discontinued. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Hyperuricaemia may occur, or gout may be precipitated, in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Thaizide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.

Read moreAdecin is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins.As antibacterial concentrations of Adecin are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Adecin has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Adecin combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Adecin to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected.

Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.",

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake.

Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from kidney back into the circulation.

This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Admira treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Admira has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Admira is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Admira is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe reactions to penicillins or to any other beta lactam drugs.Cefadroxil should not be combined with bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol) since an antagonistic effect is possible.Treatment with cefadroxil in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, polymyxin B, colistin or high-dose loop diuretics should be avoided since such combinations can potentiate nephrotoxic effects. Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery. Urinary sugar should be determined enzymatically (e.g. with test strips) during treatment with cefadroxil since reduction tests can furnish falsely elevated values.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.",

Co-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, including cobicistat-containing products, is expected to increase the risk of systemic side-effects. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side-effects. The metabolism of Aeronid is primarily mediated by CYP3A4. Inhibitors of this enzyme, e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole, can therefore increase systemic exposure to Aeronid several times. Since there are no data to support dosage recommendations, the combination should be avoided. If this is not possible, the period between treatments should be as long as possible and a reduction of the Aeronid dose could also be considered. Limited data about this interaction for high-dose inhaled Aeronid indicate that marked increases in plasma levels (on average four- fold) may occur if itraconazole, 200 mg once daily, is administered concomitantly with inhaled Aeronid (single dose of 1000 µg). Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and saquinavir are also likely to markedly increase plasma concentrations of Aeronid. Cimetidine has a weak but clinically insignificant inhibiting effect on hepatic metabolism of Aeronid. Raised plasma concentrations of and enhanced effects of corticosteroids have been observed in women also treated with oestrogens and contraceptive steroids, but no effect has been observed with Aeronid and concomitant intake of low dose combination oral contraceptives. The suppressive effect on adrenal function is additive if used concomitantly with systemic or intranasal steroids. Because adrenal function may be suppressed, an ACTH stimulation test for diagnosing pituitary insufficiency might show false results (low values).",

Facial irritation, as an example of a hypersensitivity reaction, has occurred in some cases when a Nebuliser with a face mask has been used. To prevent irritation the facial skin should be washed with water after use of the face mask. In-placebo controlled studies, cataract was also uncommonly reported in the placebo group. Clinical trials with 13,119 patients on inhaled Aeronid and 7,278 patients on placebo have been pooled. The frequency of anxiety was 0.52% on inhaled Aeronid and 0.63% on placebo; that of depression was 0.67% on inhaled Aeronid and 1.15% on placebo. There is an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with newly diagnosed COPD starting treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. However a weighted assessment of 8 pooled clinical trials involving 4643 COPD patients treated with Aeronid and 3,643 patients randomized to non-ICS treatments did not demonstrate an increased risk for pneumonia. The results from the first 7 of these 8 trials have been published as a meta-analysis. Treatment with inhaled Aeronid may result in candida infection in the oropharynx. Experience has shown that candida infection occurs less often when inhalation is performed before meals and/or when the mouth is rinsed after inhalation. In most cases this condition responds to topical anti-fungal therapy without discontinuing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Coughing can usually be prevented by inhaling a beta-2 agonist (e.g. terbutaline) 5-10 minutes before administration of Aeronid 0.5mg Nebuliser Suspension. Occasionally, signs or symptoms of systemic glucocorticosteroid-side effects may occur with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, probably depending on dose, exposure time, concomitant and previous corticosteroid exposure, and individual sensitivity. These may include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma, and susceptibility to infections. The ability to adapt to stress may be impaired. The systemic effects described, however, are much less likely to occur with inhaled Aeronid than with oral corticosteroids.",

        "information": "The transfer of patients treated with oral corticosteroids to the inhaled corticosteroid and their subsequent management requires special care. The patients should be in a reasonably stable state before initiating a high dose of inhaled corticosteroid in addition to their usual maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroid. After about 10 days, withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroid is started by reducing the daily dose gradually (by for example 2.5 milligrams prednisolone or the equivalent each month) to the lowest possible level. It may be possible to completely replace the oral corticosteroid with inhaled corticosteroid. Transferred patients whose adrenocortical function is impaired may need supplementary systemic corticosteroid during periods of stress e.g. surgery, infection or worsening asthma attacks. Patients who have required high dose emergency corticosteroid therapy or prolonged treatment at the highest recommended dose of inhaled corticosteroids, may also be at risk of impaired adrenal function. These patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to severe stress. Additional systemic corticosteroid treatment should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery. During transfer from oral therapy to inhaled Aeronid, symptoms may appear that had previously been suppressed by systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, for example symptoms of allergic rhinitis, eczema, muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment should be co-administered to treat these conditions. Some patients may feel unwell in a non-specific way during the withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids despite maintenance or even improvement in respiratory function. Such patients should be encouraged to continue treatment with inhaled Aeronid and withdrawal of oral corticosteroid unless there are clinical signs to indicate the contrary, for example signs which might indicate adrenal insufficiency. As with other inhalation therapies paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, manifested by an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. Paradoxical bronchospasm responds to a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated straight away. Aeronid should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and, if necessary, alternative treatment instituted. When an acute episode of dyspnoea occurs despite a well monitored treatment, a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used and medical reassessment should be considered. If despite maximum doses of inhaled corticosteroids, asthma symptoms are not adequately controlled, patients may require short-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In such cases, it is necessary to maintain the inhaled corticosteroid therapy in association with treatment by the systemic route. Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. Influence on growth: It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. Patients who have previously been dependent on oral corticosteroids may, as a result of prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, experience effects of impaired adrenal function. Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of oral corticosteroid therapy and hence oral steroid-dependent patients transferred to Aeronid may remain at risk from impaired adrenocortical function for some considerable time. In such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should be monitored regularly. Oral candidiasis may occur during the therapy with inhaled corticosteroids. This infection may require treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and in some patients discontinuation of treatment may be necessary Exacerbation of clinical symptoms of asthma may be due to acute respiratory tract bacterial infections and treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be required. Such patients may need to increase the dose of inhaled Aeronid and a short course of oral corticosteroids may be required. A rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used as “rescue” medication to relieve acute asthma symptoms. Special care and adequate specific therapeutic control of patients with active and quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis is necessary before commencing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Similarly patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airways require close observation and special care and should use Aeronid only if they are also receiving adequate treatment for such infections. In patients with excessive mucous secretion in the respiratory tract, short-term therapy with oral corticosteroids may be necessary. In patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, treatment with inhaled Aeronid can result in a reduced elimination rate and hence enhanced systemic availability. Possible systemic effects may then result and therefore HPA axis function in these patients should be monitored at regular intervals. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. If this is not possible the time interval between administration of the two drugs should be as long as possible. Recent epidemiological studies show that there is an increased incidence of pneumonia in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with inhaled corticosteroids, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.7. Care should be exercised in prescribing Aeronid for those patients whose respiratory disease might have a component of COPD. Visual disturbance: Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids.

A high dose of budesonide Nebuliser suspension is then given in combination with the previously used oral steroid dose for about 10 days. After that, the oral steroid dose should be gradually reduced (by for example 2.5 milligrams prednisolone or the equivalent each month) to the lowest possible level. In many cases, it is possible to completely substitute the oral steroid with budesonide Nebuliser suspension. For further information on the withdrawal of corticosteroids, when tapering off systemic corticosteroids some patients will experience steroid withdrawal symptoms, e.g. joint and/or muscle pain, lack of energy and depression or even a decreased lung function. Such patients must be advised to continue the inhaled budesonide therapy, but they should also be examined for any objective signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. If such signs are present, the dose of the systemic corticosteroid should be temporarily increased and then tapered off even more slowly. In periods of stress or severe asthma attacks, patients in the transition phase may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids.",

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat. Afexa improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity. Chronic idiopathic urticaria: Afexa is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Afexa significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, the number of wheals, and pruritus. Afexa improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.",

        "information": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Afexa caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract.

Afluzole has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Afluzole and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Afluzole 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop. Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

        "information": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Afluzole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

        "information": "Aggra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Aggra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Aggra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Aggra concentrations when coadministered with Aggra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Aggra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Aggra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Aggra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Aggra Cmax and a 210% increase in Aggra AUC. Aggra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Aggra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Aggra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Aggra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Aggra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Aggra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Aggra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Aggra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Aggra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Aggra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Aggra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Aggra AUC and a 55% decrease in Aggra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Aggra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Aggra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Aggra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Aggra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Aggra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Aggra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Aggra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Aggra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Aggra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Aggra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Aggra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Aggra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Aggra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Aggra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Aggra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Aggra dosage is recommended.",

Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.

Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Aggra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Aggra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Aggra concentrations when coadministered with Aggra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Aggra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Aggra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Aggra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Aggra Cmax and a 210% increase in Aggra AUC. Aggra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Aggra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Aggra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Aggra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Aggra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Aggra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Aggra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Aggra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Aggra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Aggra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Aggra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Aggra AUC and a 55% decrease in Aggra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Aggra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Aggra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Aggra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Aggra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers.

        "information": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Aggra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Aggra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Aggra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Aggra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Aggra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Aggra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Aggra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Aggra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Aggra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Aggra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Aggra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Aggra dosage is recommended.",

Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions. Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.

Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended. Afluzole has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Afluzole and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind. In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind. Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered. Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Afluzole 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers. A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended. Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs. In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Afluzole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

If the patient continues to experience symptoms after using this inhaler or requires more doses of this inhaler than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires evaluation of the patient and their treatment regimen. This inhaler can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with this inhaler, it should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted. this inhaler, like other drugs containing beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or other symptoms. If such effects occur, this inhaler may need to be discontinued. As with other inhaled drugs containing beta-adrenergic agents, this inhaler should not be used more than the maximum daily as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur after administration of salbutamol sulfate and budesonide, components of this inhaler, as demonstrated by cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal edema, rash, and urticaria. Discontinue this inhaler if such reactions occur. this inhaler, like all therapies containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders. hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible patients using corticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. This inhaler contains budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), Localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans have occurred in patients treated with ICS agents. Monitor patients periodically. Budesonide, a component of this inhaler, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone, Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, post-menopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the long-term administration of ICS, including budesonide, a component of this inhaler. Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of this inhaler with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.. ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur. Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients.

These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.",

Exposure to intense sunlight or to UV rays should be avoided. Where necessary a sun-protection product with a high protection factor of at least SPF 15 should be used. Aggressive chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should be avoided in patients on Aknill for a period of 5-6 months after the end of the treatment because of the risk of hypertrophic scarring in atypical areas and more rarely post inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation in treated areas. Wax depilation should be avoided in patients on Aknill for at least a period of 6 months after treatment because of the risk of epidermal stripping. Concurrent administration of Aknill with topical keratolytic or exfoliative anti-acne agents should be avoided as local irritation may increase. Patients should be advised to use a skin moisturising ointment or cream and a lip balm from the start of treatment as Aknill is likely to cause dryness of the skin and lips. There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin reactions (e.g. erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with Aknill use. As these events may be difficult to distinguish from other skin reactions that may occur, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for severe skin reactions. If a severe skin reaction is suspected, Aknill treatment should be discontinued. Allergic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported, in some cases after previous topical exposure to retinoids. Allergic cutaneous reactions are reported infrequently.

These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.",

Exposure to intense sunlight or to UV rays should be avoided. Where necessary a sun-protection product with a high protection factor of at least SPF 15 should be used. Aggressive chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should be avoided in patients on Aknill for a period of 5-6 months after the end of the treatment because of the risk of hypertrophic scarring in atypical areas and more rarely post inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation in treated areas. Wax depilation should be avoided in patients on Aknill for at least a period of 6 months after treatment because of the risk of epidermal stripping. Concurrent administration of Aknill with topical keratolytic or exfoliative anti-acne agents should be avoided as local irritation may increase. Patients should be advised to use a skin moisturising ointment or cream and a lip balm from the start of treatment as Aknill is likely to cause dryness of the skin and lips. There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin reactions (e.g. erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with Aknill use. As these events may be difficult to distinguish from other skin reactions that may occur, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for severe skin reactions. If a severe skin reaction is suspected, Aknill treatment should be discontinued. Allergic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported, in some cases after previous topical exposure to retinoids. Allergic cutaneous reactions are reported infrequently.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Because alpha-lipoic acid seems to work like an antioxidant, it might provide protection to the brain. People most commonly use a -lipoic acid for nerve pain in people with diabetes. It is also used for obesity, altitude sickness, aging skin, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and many other purposes. Alpha-lipoic acid is a substance that can be naturally found in animal and plant tissues and maintains its activity both in aqueous cell compartments and in lipid membrane ones. Alpha-lipoic acid has multiple antioxidant mechanisms, including metal chelating, regenerating endogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, and modulating several signaling pathways, Alpha-lipoic acid plays a significant role in managing peripheral neuropathy, particularly diabetic neuropathy, Alpha-lipoic acid can pass easily into the brain, it may help protect the brain and nerve tissue, a-lipoic acid helps lower blood sugar levels. Its ability to kill free radicals may help people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, who have pain, burning, itching, tingling, and numbness in arms and legs from nerve damage, Alpha-lipoic acid has been found to reduce the expression of GLUT~4s (Glucose transporter type 4) in cells, responsible for glucose uptake, and hence reduce Insulin sensitivity.",

Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours.

Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined. This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.",

Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined. This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

        "information": "Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H] alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H] alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.",

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

        "information": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alerfast caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract.

        "information": "As with all alpha-1-blockers in some subjects, in particular patients receiving antihypertensive medications or nitrates, postural hypotension with or without symptoms (dizziness, fatigue, sweating) may develop within a few hours following administration. In such cases, the patient should lie down until the symptoms have completely disappeared. These effects are transient, occur at the beginning of treatment and do not usually prevent the continuation of treatment. The patient should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events. As with all alpha1-receptor blockers, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with acute cardiac failure. Care should be taken when Alfuzosin Hydrochloride is administered to patients who have had a pronounced hypotensive response to another alpha-1-blocker. Treatment should be initiated gradually in patients with hypersensitivity to alpha-1-blockers. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be administered carefully to patients being treated with antihypertensives. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. Patients with congenital QTc prolongation, with a known history of acquired QTc prolongation or who are taking drugs known to increase the QTc interval should be evaluated before and during the administration of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride. In coronary patients, the specific treatment for coronary insufficiency should be continued. If angina pectoris reappears or worsens Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be discontinued. As there are no clinical safety data available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30ml/min), Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged released tablets should not be administered to this patient group. Patients should be warned that the tablet should be swallowed whole. Any other mode of administration, such as crunching, crushing, chewing, grinding or pounding to powder should be prohibited. These actions may lead to inappropriate release and absorption of the drug and therefore possible early adverse reactions. The ‘Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome’ (IFIS, a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-1-blockers. Although the risk of this event with Alfuzosin Hydrochloride appears very low, ophthalmic surgeons should be informed in advance of cataract surgery of current or past use of alpha-1-blockers, as IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications. The ophthalmologists should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged release tablets contain hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.",

The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.",

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Aircast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Aircast. No dosage adjustment for Aircast is recommended.

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alafree caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite.

Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined. This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.",

The 50 mL dosage form would be appropriate for pediatric use, with a dose of 10-20 mL per kg of body weight infused intravenously at a rate up to 5-10 mL per minute. Therapy should be guided by the clinical response, blood pressure and an assessment of relative anemia. If more than 1000 mL are given, or if hemorrhage has occurred, the administration of packed red blood cells may be desirable. In severe burns, immediate therapy should include large volumes of crystalloid with lesser amounts of 5% albumin solution to maintain an adequate plasma volume. After the first 24 hours, the ratio of albumin to crystalloid may be increased to establish and maintain a plasma albumin level of about 2.5 g/100 mL or a total serum protein level of about 5.2 g/100 mL. However, an optimal regimen for the use of colloids, electrolytes and water after severe burns has not been established. The infusion of Albumin (Human) as a nutrient in the treatment of chronic hypoproteinemia is not recommended. In acute hypoproteinemia, 5% albumin may be used in replacing the protein lost in hypoproteinemic conditions. However, if edema is present or if large amounts of albumin are lost, Albumin (Human) 25% is preferred because of the greater amount of protein in the concentrated solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",

Tenofovir alafenamide is then converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis primarily by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary hepatocytes. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain termination.

No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alerfex caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Alerfex and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.",

To obtain a full secretory endometrium in oestrogen-primed castrated women or to postpone menstruation (with an oestrogen added) in normal ovulating women, doses of allylestrenol were required which were higher than those recommended for the treatment/prevention of abortion. In vitro studies have shown that allylestrenol stimulates the synthesis of progesterone in the human placenta. It also brought about a significant (p/. 0,01) increase in the production of some specific placental enzymes (cystine aminopeptidase and heat-stable alkaline phosphatase). Histological and histochemical changes indicating an increased activity have been found in the placenta, particularly in the syncytiotrophoblast of women with a normal and threatened pregnancy, treated with allylestrenol. The stimulatory effect of allylestrenol on placental function was also suggested by the increased level of placental hormones (pregnanediol, oestriol, HCG and HPL) and enzymes (oxytocinase, CAP) in the maternal urine and plasma, which followed the administration of the drug e.g. in the early weeks as well as in the last trimester of pregnancy. A study in full-term pregnant women revealed that allylestrenol in high doses (up to 100 mg daily) did suppress the intensity of spontaneous uterine contractions, but had no effect on the sensitivity of the uterine muscle to oxytocin, and no adverse effect on the progress of normal delivery. Studies in non-pregnant women with and without endocrinological disorders have shown that allylestrenol has no oestrogenic or androgenic properties and no adverse effects on the adrenal function. No abnormal liver function tests or water and salt retention were observed in healthy female volunteers (non pregnant) who were given allylestrenol.",

        "information": "As with all alpha-1-blockers in some subjects, in particular patients receiving antihypertensive medications or nitrates, postural hypotension with or without symptoms (dizziness, fatigue, sweating) may develop within a few hours following administration. In such cases, the patient should lie down until the symptoms have completely disappeared. These effects are transient, occur at the beginning of treatment and do not usually prevent the continuation of treatment. The patient should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events. As with all alpha1-receptor blockers, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with acute cardiac failure. Care should be taken when Alfuzosin Hydrochloride is administered to patients who have had a pronounced hypotensive response to another alpha-1-blocker. Treatment should be initiated gradually in patients with hypersensitivity to alpha-1-blockers. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be administered carefully to patients being treated with antihypertensives. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. Patients with congenital QTc prolongation, with a known history of acquired QTc prolongation or who are taking drugs known to increase the QTc interval should be evaluated before and during the administration of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride. In coronary patients, the specific treatment for coronary insufficiency should be continued. If angina pectoris reappears or worsens Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be discontinued. As there are no clinical safety data available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30ml/min), Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged released tablets should not be administered to this patient group. Patients should be warned that the tablet should be swallowed whole. Any other mode of administration, such as crunching, crushing, chewing, grinding or pounding to powder should be prohibited. These actions may lead to inappropriate release and absorption of the drug and therefore possible early adverse reactions. The ‘Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome’ (IFIS, a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-1-blockers. Although the risk of this event with Alfuzosin Hydrochloride appears very low, ophthalmic surgeons should be informed in advance of cataract surgery of current or past use of alpha-1-blockers, as IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications. The ophthalmologists should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged release tablets contain hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.",

An element or mineral necessary for normal nerve, muscle, and cardiac function, calcium as the gluconate salt helps to maintain calcium balance and prevent bone loss when taken orally.

Coral Calcium is similar to other sources but ensures better absorption. Vitamin D3 aids in the absorption of Calcium from GI tract and helps to maintain Calcium balance in the body. Calcium is used as a pharmacological agent in humans almost entirely to remedy the deficiency. Adequate calcium in the blood is so vital to a wide variety of bodily functions that our internal biochemistry will not tolerate a deficiency even for short periods. Vitamin C is an essential component of the diet as humans cannot synthesize Vitamin C. It is a very powerful reducing agent and plays an important part in the response of the body to stress. It is important in the defense against infections. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation.

The suspension work in two ways- The mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",

The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.",

The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.",

Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligandgated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels, and Ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.",

        "information": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Alkaparol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Alkaparol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Alkaparol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours.

Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours.

To obtain a full secretory endometrium in oestrogen-primed castrated women or to postpone menstruation (with an oestrogen added) in normal ovulating women, doses of allylestrenol were required which were higher than those recommended for the treatment/prevention of abortion. In vitro studies have shown that allylestrenol stimulates the synthesis of progesterone in the human placenta. It also brought about a significant (p/. 0,01) increase in the production of some specific placental enzymes (cystine aminopeptidase and heat-stable alkaline phosphatase). Histological and histochemical changes indicating an increased activity have been found in the placenta, particularly in the syncytiotrophoblast of women with a normal and threatened pregnancy, treated with allylestrenol. The stimulatory effect of allylestrenol on placental function was also suggested by the increased level of placental hormones (pregnanediol, oestriol, HCG and HPL) and enzymes (oxytocinase, CAP) in the maternal urine and plasma, which followed the administration of the drug e.g. in the early weeks as well as in the last trimester of pregnancy. A study in full-term pregnant women revealed that allylestrenol in high doses (up to 100 mg daily) did suppress the intensity of spontaneous uterine contractions, but had no effect on the sensitivity of the uterine muscle to oxytocin, and no adverse effect on the progress of normal delivery. Studies in non-pregnant women with and without endocrinological disorders have shown that allylestrenol has no oestrogenic or androgenic properties and no adverse effects on the adrenal function. No abnormal liver function tests or water and salt retention were observed in healthy female volunteers (non pregnant) who were given allylestrenol.",

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

No serious adverse events were observed at these doses. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to institute the necessary clinical monitoring and supportive therapy as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Per clinical judgment, it may be reasonable to initiate removal of unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract. Aloglip is minimally dialyzable; over a 3-hour hemodialysis session, approximately 7% of the drug was removed. Therefore, hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in an overdose situation.

In breast cancer cell lines, Alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets, including Akt and showed activity in cell lines harboring a PIK3CA mutation. In vivo, Alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reduced tumor growth in xenograft models, including models of breast cancer. PI3K inhibition by Alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in estrogen receptor (ER) transcription in breast cancer cells.

In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphalok has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment.

Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms.

In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur. B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.",

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Ambfex caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract.

Two receptor subtypes, ET A and ET B , mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ETA are vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ETB are vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance. Ambrisentan is a high-affinity ETA receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ET A versus ET B receptor (>4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ET A is not known. The pharmacokinetics of Ambrisentan (S-Ambrisentan) in healthy subjects are dose proportional. The absolute bioavailability of Ambrisentan is not known. Ambrisentan is absorbed with peak concentrations occurring approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy subjects and PAH patients. Food does not affect its bioavailability. In vitro studies indicate that Ambrisentan is a substrate of P-gp. Ambrisentan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). The elimination of Ambrisentan is predominantly by non-renal pathways, but the relative contributions of metabolism and biliary elimination have not been well characterized. In plasma, the AUC of 4-hydroxymethyl Ambrisentan accounts for approximately 4% relative to parent Ambrisentan AUC. Thein vivo inversion of S-Ambrisentan to R-Ambrisentan is negligible. The mean oral clearance of Ambrisentan is 38 mL/min and 19 mL/min in healthy subjects and in PAH patients, respectively. Although Ambrisentan has a 15-hour terminal half-life, the mean trough concentration of Ambrisentan at steady-state is about 15% of the mean peak concentration and the accumulation factor is about 1.2 after long-term daily dosing, indicating that the effective half-life of Ambrisentan is about 9 hours.",

Lapatinib inhibits ErbB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. An additive effect was demonstrated in an in vitro study when Lapatinib and 5-FU (the active metabolite of Capecitabine) were used in combination in the 4 tumor cell lines tested. The growth inhibitory effects of Lapatinib were evaluated in Trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in Trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents. Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells (with ER [Estrogen Receptor] and/or PgR [Progesterone Receptor]) that coexpress the HER2 tend to be resistant to established endocrine therapies.
