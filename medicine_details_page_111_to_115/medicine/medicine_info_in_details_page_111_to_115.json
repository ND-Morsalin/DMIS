Zinc supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc also has some antioxidant properties. Zinc is used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder) in children. In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur. B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.",

It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",

        "information": "Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities.",

Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumour, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumour tissue. Capecitabine is a prodrug that is selectively tumour-activated to its cytotoxic moiety, fluorouracil, by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme found in higher concentrations in many tumours compared to normal tissues or plasma. Fluorouracil is further metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), within normal and tumour cells. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N 5-10 methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2-deoxyuridylate. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, therefore a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Secondly, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis through the production of fraudulent RNA.",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Cabonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide.

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Cal-aid is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Cal-aid containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Elemental Cal-aid tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS.

An element or mineral necessary for normal nerve, muscle, and cardiac function, calcium as the gluconate salt helps to maintain calcium balance and prevent bone loss when taken orally.

Coral Calcium is similar to other sources but ensures better absorption. Vitamin D3 aids in the absorption of Calcium from GI tract and helps to maintain Calcium balance in the body. Calcium is used as a pharmacological agent in humans almost entirely to remedy the deficiency. Adequate calcium in the blood is so vital to a wide variety of bodily functions that our internal biochemistry will not tolerate a deficiency even for short periods. Vitamin C is an essential component of the diet as humans cannot synthesize Vitamin C. It is a very powerful reducing agent and plays an important part in the response of the body to stress. It is important in the defense against infections. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies show that calcium and vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in osteoporosis and fracture prevention.",

Read moreCalbostar tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. To fulfill the calcium deficiency or meet extra need of calcium, it may be used in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, latent tetany, postmenopausal osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis, juvenile osteoporosis, drug (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone) induced osteoporosis, pregnancy and lactation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hypoparathyroidism and hip joint plastic surgery.Calbostar acts against a number of inflammatory diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, spondylitis, various cardiovascular ailments, encephalitis, retinitis, phlebitis, colitis, and multiple sclerosis. Calbostar helps in controlling weight by suppressing the habit of frequent appetite of chronic overeaters. It is also beneficial in reducing the effects of mood swings and is proved to be quite effective in cognitive enhancement. Calbostar protects the heart by enhancing the efficiency of cardiac muscles. Recent studies on Calbostar indicate its potential to minimize the risk of colon cancer.",

Read moreCalbostar tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. To fulfill the calcium deficiency or meet extra need of calcium, it may be used in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, latent tetany, postmenopausal osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis, juvenile osteoporosis, drug (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone) induced osteoporosis, pregnancy and lactation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hypoparathyroidism and hip joint plastic surgery.Calbostar acts against a number of inflammatory diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, spondylitis, various cardiovascular ailments, encephalitis, retinitis, phlebitis, colitis, and multiple sclerosis. Calbostar helps in controlling weight by suppressing the habit of frequent appetite of chronic overeaters. It is also beneficial in reducing the effects of mood swings and is proved to be quite effective in cognitive enhancement. Calbostar protects the heart by enhancing the efficiency of cardiac muscles. Recent studies on Calbostar indicate its potential to minimize the risk of colon cancer.",

Thiazide-type diuretics can interact with Calbostar supplements, increasing the risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Both aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids increase urinary calcium excretion. Mineral oil and stimulant laxatives decrease calcium absorption. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, can cause calcium depletion and eventually osteoporosis when they are used for months. Oral contraceptives as well as estrogen compounds reduce calcium.

        "information": "Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscle, and bone. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones. Having the right amount of calcium is important for building and keeping strong bones. Calcium citrate is well absorbed on an empty stomach and does not constipate. Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption. Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D 3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. It is normally formed in the kidneys from its immediate precursor, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In physiological amounts it augments the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and plays a significant part in the regulation of bone mineralization. The defective production of calcitriol in chronic renal failure contributes to the abnormalities of mineral metabolism found in that disorder. The biological effects of calcitriol are mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in most cell types and functioning as a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds to DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes. Oral administration of Calcitriol to patients with chronic renal failure compensates for impaired endogenous production of calcitriol which is decreased when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min. Consequently, intestinal malabsorption of calcium and phosphate and the resulting hypocalcemia are improved, thereby reversing the signs and symptoms of bone disease. In patients with established post-menopausal osteoporosis, Calcitriol increases calcium absorption, elevates circulating levels of calcitriol and reduces vertebral fracture frequency.",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcicar is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide.

Calcin-O helps in controlling weight by suppressing the habit of frequent appetite of chronic overeaters. It is also beneficial in reducing the effects of mood swings and is proved to be quite effective in cognitive enhancement. Calcin-O protects the heart by enhancing the efficiency of cardiac muscles. Recent studies on Calcin-O indicate its potential to minimize the risk of colon cancer.",

Read moreCalcin-O DS tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. To fulfill the calcium deficiency or meet extra need of calcium, it may be used in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, latent tetany, postmenopausal osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis, juvenile osteoporosis, drug (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone) induced osteoporosis, pregnancy and lactation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hypoparathyroidism and hip joint plastic surgery.Calcin-O DS acts against a number of inflammatory diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, spondylitis, various cardiovascular ailments, encephalitis, retinitis, phlebitis, colitis, and multiple sclerosis. Calcin-O DS helps in controlling weight by suppressing the habit of frequent appetite of chronic overeaters. It is also beneficial in reducing the effects of mood swings and is proved to be quite effective in cognitive enhancement. Calcin-O DS protects the heart by enhancing the efficiency of cardiac muscles. Recent studies on Calcin-O DS indicate its potential to minimize the risk of colon cancer.",
